For those of you who have been dancing to the rhythms of the drums of war being continuously beaten by the PDP, Nnamdi Kanu and his IPOB rats, CAN, NCEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Femi Fani-Kayode, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Gani Adam's, Afenifere, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF, etc. I hope the corona virus pandemic and the accompanying lockdown has given you a very faint idea of what a war situation would be like. Just under seven weeks of a lockdown, and you are already screaming of hunger and begging for palliatives from Buhari. Let me assure you that whatever hardships or inconvenience you think you are suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer if war ever breaks out as a result of the ""Biafra or death"", ""Islamization"", ""Fulani jihad"", ""Fulanization"", and ""Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria"" propaganda churned out by Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF etc, and your spiritual Papas and Daddy G.Os. They have been beating the drums of propaganda and war with a very big stick, and you have been dancing furious steps to the rhythms. They tell you that Buhari wants to Islamize Nigeria, and you cheer. They say Buhari is the one arming and sending Fulani herdsmen to kill you, and you scream delightedly. They say Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria, and you believe them. They say Buhari wants to kill every Southerner along with those in the Middle-Belt, and give the vacant land to his Fulani kinsmen, and you agree. They incite the Igbos against other Nigerians, and you rejoice. They incite Christians against Muslims, and you dance for joy. They abuse Northerners and Muslims and Fulanis and the Yorubas, and you celebrate. You call Fulanis and Northerners cows. You call Nigeria a zoo and other Nigerians animals in the zoo. They tell you to get ready to fight a war and defend yourselves and your land against the Sokoto Caliphate and the sons of Usman Dan Fodio, and you scream in excitement. They call the Fulanis bloodthirsty demons from Futa Jallon, and you are giddy with delight. This is the rubbish that the PDP, CAN, NCEF, your Pastors and Daddy G.Os, Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Reno Omokri, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle-Belt forum, South-South Leaders Forum, PANDEF, etc, have been feeding you with for ages, and you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker, instead of using your braino like rational beings. They have politicised religion and weaponised it as a tool of political blackmail. They have been playing the religious card in a very dangerous and reckless manner since 2014, viciously fanning the smouldering embers of ethno-tribal and religious divisions and hatred. I want to announce to you that if and when the conflagration ignites, whatever you think you're suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer in a war situation. You are screaming for palliatives now, but nobody will give you palliatives in a war situation. I heard that in some parts of the Country, the prices of foodstuffs have risen astronomically. For example, a paint bucket of garri is now selling at N1800 in some parts of the country. The cost of satchets and bags of ""Pure Water"" have doubled. In a war situation, you will buy a paint bucket of garri for N10,000 or more, i.e if you could even see it to buy. Let me not talk about the other staples like yam, beans, rice, cassava, etc. A wrap of ""Akpu"" may cost as much as N1000. You will buy a loaf of bread for N7000, assuming it is even available. You have been shouting ""hunger"" and "" hardship"" since Buhari came to power, but in a war situation, you will know what ""hunger"" and ""hardship"" is. Then you will realize that what you are currently experiencing is Paradise in comparison. You are complaining that you are tired of staying at home because of the lockdown. In a war situation, you will most likely not even have a home to stay in; you will be too busy running for your life or hiding in the bush or the forest, or living in a refugee camp. You are complaining that health facilities are poor; in a war situation, there will be no hospitals to go to, because many of them will be bombed or razed to the ground, and the few available ones will be overflowing with war casualties. Believe you me, those your Daddy G.Os and Spiritual Papas will hop on their private jets and fly out of the Country if and when those embers of ethno-tribal and religious hate they have been fanning ignite, and leave you to face the music. Those Ohanaeze and Afenifere and Middle-Belt Forum and South-South Leaders Forum and PANDEF politicians will race to the nearest Foreign Embassy building and hide themselves there, and leave you to roast in the fire.

Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria.

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I don't believe in the ZOO called Nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he said. I LOVE JESUS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man? 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine? 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37.

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business. That is the ZOO for you. 39. The reason why what is happening about SARS is resonating 40.

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25.

Opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. I say good evening to some of you, as I welcome you, I want you to welcome others. 3. My people in Akwa-Ibom they say ""Abasi mbong"" our people in urhobo say Tamuno. 4. I want you to pay attention to what I have to say this evening. 5. You have heard this clip before very many years ago and I want you to hear what this JANJAWEED has to say. 6. I want to prove all beyond every reasonable doubt that Fulani is the problem. 7. As I play this audio, somebody should put it on my page, that the world will know that Fulani never meant Nigeria to work from day one. 8. Buhari was following the footsteps of sardauna of Sokoto. 9. What this man said since 1950 is still active in our life today. 10. I am going to play the voice of this man again so that you can understand that this whole thing was planned years ago. 11. I want Wike, I want Ozodimgba to listen to me very well. 12. What APC is carrying out today was laid down before 1960. 13. Britain knew that Fulani hated igbo people because Britain hated igbo people. Why Britain hated igbo people is beyond me. 14. The North hates the east, they love the yoruba a little bit. that's why they said they are not leaving. 15. What is this hate or hatred for the Igbo? what has the igbos done? 16. Tribal tension has been there before the 60's and am asking people when will this tension stop? 17. A white man is asking a black baboon from Africa why do you hate a black man like you. 18. I want to prove to efulefus in the Zoo how the hatred in the Zoo today was brought. 19. Igbo people are ancient people ""ndi gboo"" that is why the are occupying the centre of the world. 20. Biafra is beyond what man can understand. 21. How did they dominate you, because everywhere they go to even a white man will ask them to run their work. 22. When you hear other tribe joining them to castigated Biafra don't blame them, anybody who is castigating Biafra will not make heaven. 23. This happened in the late 40's and Buhari has replicated the same northernisation and fulanisation. 24. Now let me prove it to you that what this man is saying over 60 years ago is still active today. 25. I have given you the first Fulani Gordy agenda of Fulanisation headed by Amadu Bello a reprobate. 26. The daughter of Abba Kyari is the one controlling the whole money of the Zoo and all of you are there shouting one Nigeria like mad people. 27. How God sent the unknown gun men we don't know but we are praying for them. 28. Let me remind some of you fools like Hope Uzodima. He said we hijacked ESN. 29. Hope Uzodima don't you wear Pampers and your fellow men are busy destroying you. 30. When they invite you to Sokoto that night you start sweating because you know what they will do you in the night. 31. NO MORE FUND RAISING IN THE ZOO, YOU ARE SOLDIERS YOU STAY IN THE BUSH UNTIL YOU ARE REFILLED . 32. On this note we have come to the end of this programme.

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU!

The International community rewards excellence and hardwork (unlike the zoo). Only Nigerians hate Igbo-Biafrans and we know why. Unfortunately for the haters, the more they hate Igbos the higher the Igbos climb. So advise them to stop hating.

They are always dub-ious and have the resources to carry out any project. Be it bad or good. Do you remember Don Wanny of Omoku Rivers State? He was friend of politicians. They used him to commit many dirty things as to win elections. But when they are done, they hunted him down to Enugu and killed him for something they got no evidence that he committed. They didn't stop there. They also went after his brother and killed him in cold blood in front of his children. The government is facing IPOB now. Lots of things are going on. Mr Ekpa works for this politicians. His job is to use his dubious charismatic way to fool some IPOB followers, then recruit some crimiinals who will do the dirty job for him. The government will be far behind giving him the required resources. There are some people on ground that are ready to do anything provided money is involved. There are also some emotional fools that embraced the struggle. These guys are so emotional that they lack reasoning and tact. They are ready to work for Mr Ekpa because they think and believe the zoo needs to be taught a lesson. They mistake teaching the zoo a lesson with terro-rising their own people. They will aid the destruction of the same struggle they so much cherished. The aim of recruiting Mr Ekpa by the government is to help make the people hate the movement. The greatest problem facing Nigeria government is the fact that almost 90% of Ndị Igbo are pro IPOB. This needs to be punctured. And how can this be done. By terro-rizing the people in the name of freedom, IPOB and Biafra. There is a limit to what the people can take. The story of freedom is always beautiful, but the journey is always painful. Remember the Israelites on their way out of Egypt? They all were happy to leave Egypt at first, but on the way they faced difficulties and murmured against God and Moses. They wished to go back to Egypt and suffer than face what they are presently facing in the name of going to the promise land. Nigeria government desperately need the people of Biafra to turn against this very struggle and that is the job of Mr Ekpa. They will continue to terro-rize the people to the extent that the people will rise up against their own freedom. Don't forget that many are not registered IPOB members but they are fully in support of IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Imagine a situation where Mr Ekpa's gangs on ground starts terro-rising them that they start working against the struggle. This will Isolate the registered members to the extent that they will go underground or even denounce their struggle. Remember that many hard cores are already struggling. Some lost their jobs and many are on the run, changing from state to state. Soon we won't be only running from the wicked government agents, but from our dear brothers, no thanks to Mr Ekpa. They will even go after those writing for IPOB that are on ground. The worse thing is that those Mr Ekpa is using will be flushed out by the government like they did to Don Wanny immediately they achieve their purpose. And Mr Ekpa who is a citizen of another country will forever live happily with the money paid to him. Do you understand what I am saying? I don't really know why I am still writing and risking my safety for those that are not listening. The moment we started fighting the leadership of IPOB and command and control was the time we started endangering our lives and the life of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Don't forget that the master said he won't disappoint you, but you will disappoint him. He also turned around to tell someone not to allow Satan enter him. I will end it here. They will try, but they won't see us. And most importantly, they will fail.

A warning that came in the wake of the indiscriminate shootings and burning down of houses by the Nigerian soldiers in a small community located somewhere in Enugu State, which surfaced on the social media on the Monday 1st of November, 2021. By every indication, the video was recorded by one of the soldiers, either as a revolt against what was being done by fellow soldiers or simply, out of sheer impudence to commit such heinous crimes and still go scot-free. But whatever be the case, the crucial factor here is that the beastly crime those soldiers committed on that day, is out there for all to see. And it is only one of many such atrocities. The point has to be made about this incident so that we do not easily forget the horror that played out that day and also to give ourselves more time to digest the facts about the vampiric mortals adorning the uniforms of the Nigerian military. As it is not out of place to think that in this 21st century, the Nigerian military ought to have evolved into a modern, refined and humane institution primed to join the league of exemplary militaries across the world in the true service of humanity. But we could not have been more wrong and presumptuous of a military stubbornly stuck up in ancient times, that continues to show itself only as a barbaric force set out to maim and kill the very people it is supposed to protect. This institution has deteriorated into a worse condition than it was, prior to the government of Muhammadu Buhari. The image of that day says it all. It speaks to the peculiar character of a military drunk with hate, coupled with an uninhibited power and authority to showcase its object of hate as it so chooses. In many ways, the characters looked far more deadlier than the weapons in their hands. A murderous set of soldiers, lethal and unforgiving by any description, firing away indiscriminately at any living thing and with relative ease and enjoyment. And in plain sight, was what seemed an infinite rage of anti-Igbo coloration, as if they were on a mission to fulfill an age-old prophetic mandate of apocalyptic retaliation. Be that as it may, this could not have been glossed over or swept under the rug anywhere else but in Nigeria. And going by the entrenched culture of impunity among the Nigerian politicians and members of the armed forces, none of these murderous soldiers or their commanders is likely to be held accountable or at least, queried by the Nigerian authorities. Which tells a very macabre yet, the true story of Nigeria; a country steeped in political and economic cannibalism. And so, with such an ugly picture of indiscriminate shootings into people’s homes which is often replicated by the Nigerian military, it makes a lot of sense when ""zoo"" is metaphorically used to describe Nigeria. But not to put too fine a point on it, the metaphor is a bit too polished to fit a human abattoir like Nigeria, given that in a zoo, for example, animals have value and rights. Any attempt at jungle justice, attracts serious punishments. But in the Nigerian context, there is hardly any sense of human value among Nigerian leaders and the armed forces. It is a well known historic fact that Nigerian armed forces are undisciplined, brutal, brutally corrupt, polarized, barbaric and boundless in the commission of genocides and various other atrocious crimes against humanity. Similarly, the government of Nigeria is in lockstep with them, sanctioning all the killings of unarmed civilians and then turn around to frame such events in a way that absolves them of any wrongdoings. At present, both the military and the government are indoors plotting more military operations that will soon sweep through a broad swath of Igboland. But then again, the necessary question to ask the Nigerian government and the military generals is, what more operations are you expecting your soldiers to carry out? Let me guess: they are to embark on operations in small towns, villages, marketplaces or inside family homes in Igboland where harmless children and old people are likely to be found playing or going about their businesses. Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people.

Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25.

Just under seven weeks of a lockdown, and you are already screaming of hunger and begging for palliatives from Buhari. Let me assure you that whatever hardships or inconvenience you think you are suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer if war ever breaks out as a result of the ""Biafra or death"", ""Islamization"", ""Fulani jihad"", ""Fulanization"", and ""Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria"" propaganda churned out by Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF etc, and your Spiritual Papas and Daddy G.Os. They have been beating the drums of propaganda and war with a very big stick, and you have been dancing furious steps to the rhythms. They tell you that Buhari wants to Islamize Nigeria, and you cheer. They say Buhari is the one arming and sending Fulani herdsmen to kill you, and you scream delightedly. They say Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria, and you believe them. They say Buhari wants to kill every Southerner along with those in the Middle-Belt, and give the vacant land to his Fulani kinsmen, and you agree. They incite the Igbos against other Nigerians, and you rejoice. They incite Christians against Muslims, and you dance for joy. They abuse Northerners and Muslims and Fulanis and the Yorubas, and you celebrate. You call Fulanis and Northerners cows. You call Nigeria a zoo and other Nigerians animals in the zoo. They tell you to get ready to fight a war and defend yourselves and your land against the Sokoto Caliphate and the sons of Usman Dan Fodio, and you scream in excitement. They call the Fulanis bloodthirsty demons from Futa Jallon, and you are giddy with delight. This is the rubbish that the PDP, CAN, NCEF, your Pastors and Daddy G.Os, Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Reno Omokri, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle-Belt forum, South-South Leaders Forum, PANDEF, etc, have been feeding you with for ages, and you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker, instead of using your braino like rational beings. They have politicised religion and weaponised it as a tool of political blackmail. They have been playing the religious card in a very dangerous and reckless manner since 2014, viciously fanning the smouldering embers of ethno-tribal and religious divisions and hatred. I want to announce to you that if and when the conflagration ignites, whatever you think you're suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer in a war situation. You are screaming for palliatives now, but nobody will give you palliatives in a war situation. I heard that in some parts of the Country, the prices of foodstuffs have risen astronomically. For example, a paint bucket of garri is now selling at N1800 in some parts of the country. The cost of satchets and bags of ""Pure Water"" have doubled. In a war situation, you will buy a paint bucket of garri for N10,000 or more, i.e if you could even see it to buy. Let me not talk about the other staples like yam, beans, rice, cassava, etc. A wrap of ""Akpu"" may cost as much as N1000. You will buy a loaf of bread for N7000, assuming it is even available. You have been shouting ""hunger"" and hardship"" since Buhari came to power, but in a war situation, you will know what ""hunger"" and ""hardship"" is. Then you will realize that what you are currently experiencing is Paradise in comparison. You are complaining that you are tired of staying at home because of the lockdown. In a war situation, you will most likely not even have a home to stay in; you will be too busy running for your life or hiding in the bush or the forest, or living in a refugee camp. You are complaining that health facilities are poor; in a war situation, there will be no hospitals to go to, because many of them will be bombed or razed to the ground, and the few available ones will be overflowing with war casualties. Believe you me, those your Daddy G.Os and Spiritual Papas will hop on their private jets and fly out of the Country if and when those embers of ethno-tribal and religious hate they have been fanning ignite, and leave you to face the music. Those Ohanaeze and Afenifere and Middle-Belt Forum and South-South Leaders Forum and PANDEF politicians will race to the nearest Foreign Embassy building and hide themselves there, and leave you to roast in the fire. Unknown to you, many of them hold double and even triple citizenships. Remember the one who screamed ""Biafra or death"", but when the (truncated)",,,,,,,,,984,4.13

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU!

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened. 3. Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 5. Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man, ignorance, stupidity, jealousy, envy and greed. 6. It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 7. Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 8. I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes . 19. There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 20. Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 21. Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". you see, this is how they roll. 22. That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away, that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 23. Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off, and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 24. Have you ever wondered, your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 25. Thanks to Radio Biafra, people are now listening and have started to reason. 26. Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 27. As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 28. When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 29. The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you. 30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday, and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course. 31.

The cheers and echos increased when you read to the point of gun acquisition, 'We will gun down Nigeria', 'We'll set on fire the provinces of the Zoo cow-try', We've been charged up to full hate, ready to unleash terror on our oppressors, Kudos to our virtual commander, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, He has been doing great with the sensitizations, Spurring in us the unrelented fear to take up arms and inflict some harm. But is that really all it takes? Is marginalisation all of the problem an average Igbo man faces? On Monday, my shoe making instructor, Mr Kyrian shared with the class an experience. He began thus; ""Roughly 5 years ago, an Hausa man vanished into the thin air with my shoes worth 250,000 naira which he bought on credit"". Just as expected, we all beamed with smiles. We've known the northerners for so much ills and wrongs, pulling a major string as this wasn't a new thing, we were ready to blame our instructor for his carelessness. He trusted the wrong person, we concluded. Having our minds roaming in thoughts, Mr Kyrian broke the spell of silence with an extra line to the story. ""But the money was paid back all in full, even after the man's death"". He said. ""A deed which none of you Igbo men will do"", He mocked. The story seemed interesting, we all gathered around for full attention. 5 years ago, an Hausa man bought some shoes worth 250,000 naira from my boss. It wasn't a new thing to have your customer purchase items on credit, Once there's trust and loyalty, you always know he'll pay after sales and purchase more in his return. This Hausa man got a different tale in his business trip, The vehicle he boarded got into an accident, no one survived. Not even the Hausa man, Not even the driver. His goods seemed to be the only survivor from the trip. As occasion could have it, he always put his goods on transit in a different bus other than the one he travelled with. As gory as the accident could be, Body parts were picked along the road, Good citizens trying hard to match those parts to the owners, Trying hard to see if anyone could be resuscitated, and when no hope was coming forth, calling the owners of these corpse became a priority. As culture entails, some of these dead bodies were buried by the roadside, Their owners wouldn't want to bear an extra pain carrying them home. Days gone by, weeks transcending into months, worries mounted. Fretting over the growing silence, my boss and some other Ariaria men felt their money and goods have vanished into the thin air. Calls, texts, reports flying to and fro the ends of the world, Curses and cusses, they made sure the world knew about how risky it is to do business with these 'sons of Ishmael'. Some waited patiently, Praying to their God for a miracle. They can't risk running such loss. Just as if all hopes were gone, a call entered. One after the other, they received the goodnews. Sad news it should be, but there's hope in every tragedy. The brother to this Hausa man gave them a clear and detailed narration about the death of his brother. Not allowing them to bother any further, he promised to be in Aba for a meeting with every shoe trader involved in his brother's business. Meeting held as promised, He paid off every debt according to how the trade transpired. No Igbo trader could manipulate figures for reimbursement, Although they were surprised at such integrity, Nor could they fathom such level of accountability especially from the tribe they tagged unlearned. The deceased made sure he kept track of all his business deals in a diary, The diary was the only reasonable thing stuck to this dead body. Every dick and Harry was pleased as they received their money, Coupled with the fact that the young man continued the business of his deceased brother. In like manner he promised not to break the bonds they shared. As an appreciation, he gifted them with bags of Onions, and few tubers of yam. That was all he could afford. Having finished the story our instructor looked us all in the eyes and asked, ""How many of you Igbo men will be honest enough to demonstrate such act""? Sincerely, I doubted if any of us will have such traits of integrity. A building caught Fire in Aba, Jubilee Road, Just as the owners of shops were fighting tooth and nail to quench the fire, Some other set of persons were busy carting away valuables from these shops. A man dies in Igbo land, Just as the case of my family, instead of thinking out ways to bury the Dead, Our uncles begin making plans on how to share their brothers property, No one cares if the deceased has a family, The woman should take care of her kids; that's the mantra. An accident occurs on a major road, Aba-Owerri express way, Rescuing dead bodies is not a priority for an Igbo man, Some will stick to their routes and watch the (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/Arewasite/photos/a.349726485666472/628363951136056/?type=3,,,,,,,,747,2.69

We are going to preach without prejudice. I will start this evening by dissecting the stupidity of an Igbo man. Do you want me to beg you, so you can defend your land?. Are you not foolish?. 2. We had a whole year to plan the war, until the war came, we start running around, five Million souls already layed dead. Same thing is happening now. 3. People are not cooperating, that is why only five thousand (5000), European men took over Africa. 4. Nzeogwu, Ironsi, and Azikiwe, they were all born in the feudal North, and fought for one Nigeria. 5. People don't want to associate with Arochukwu because of slavery, this is one of the reasons why God is angry with us. 6. Most of the settlements in Ikwerre are people sold into slaves and they were their till the end of slavery. 7. God anger have been with us for a long time. 8. Due to our individualism, we are where we are today. It is a very sober broadcast this evening. 9. They have tested their first Bomb in Imo State, two persons died. You know they installed their boy Hope Uzodimma there. 10. We are the miscreants but those who are doing the killings, Nnia Nwodo exonerated them. 11. Five million people died because there was no plan, the same thing that happened then is happening now, fifty solid years, Igbos have learnt nothing only claiming intellectuals. 12. A white man have shame, honour and integrity, black man have none that is the difference between a white man and a black man. 13. I begged you to donate one dollar each in Los Angeles, somebody asked why, I said it is because we need to prepare. Did you do it?. They were thinking if all of us contribute dollar each, Nnamdi Kanu will have millions now. Now Fulanis' are in your place. 14. Most of you in America are not spiritual, if you are you will know why Elohim sent you to America. 15. The love you have for your nation is the greatest love and your willingness to sacrifice to keep your nation progressing, not like the zoo. 16. Fulani Janjaweed went as far as Madagascar to bring drugs. 17. Every blessed day, Fulani Janjaweed is telling you, showing you they hate you. 18. Elohim will give us Biafra, what we will do to you people in America, the world will wonder, I say my thing laud and clear so that your envy will increase. 19. In 1967 we lost five million souls and in the year 2020, you are still doing the same thing. 20. Let me see anyone that say he is contesting for election, then you will buy rice and beans, today those you want to vote for you have their lives under threat and you can't do no anything 21. Every four years, they come out and ask you to vote for us and they will later stall whoever they like in Abuja. 22. I wonder what our ancestors will be thinking of you people right now. Serve your people and you are asking what you are going to gain. 23. In 2009 I told those in the north one day they will kill you and you will abandon all your properties. 24. Fulani hates you because Nzeogwu killed Ahamdu Bello. Nzeogwu was trying to save Nigeria. 25. Elohim please give us Biafra so we can set example with those stingy bastard in America. 26. They cannot learn from Kosovo and Armenia. 27. We are fighting for our freedom at the most difficult time, where there is no trust, the little trust left was destroyed by Uwazuruike. 28. Defending our land is a collective effort. You want me to beg you before you can rise up and defend your land. When George Washington was fighting for America, did he have to beg people to join?. That is the America you are enjoying. 29. There will be no movement on 30th May, atleast till its noon. 30. If you truly believe in something, I don't think anything anybody say will make you change your stand. 31. Our goal is simply to get Biafra. 32. You cannot see a Christian or Muslim renouncing their faith. People don't know that Biafra is a religion. 33. You said somebody insulted you and because of that you cannot fight for Biafra again but Almajiri have been in your village killing since 1945. Peter was crucified upside down in Rome, did it stop them?. 34. Once you defend them on the ground, Britain will give them aircraft to bomb you, we need weapons that can get down their aircrafts. 35. Any day they start killing and you retaliate, you will see them bombing your homes. 36. As we speak, Kaduna Christians are being massacred, the news broke out this evening. 37. Indigenous Christian communities in Southerner Kaduna, Seven [7] local government Area are being slaughtered. 38. An Igbo man in America is praying that the Fulanis' will come and kill us so he will come back and take the land belonging to the uncles wife. 39. There are Fulani native doctors in Ogbunike. Traitors in Ogbunike because of Money sold out lands (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/MaziSomtoOkonkwo/photos/a.1235812139918467/1617580515074959/?type=3,,,,,,,,706,-2.78

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=177554787721283&set=a.163719255771503&type=3,,,Photos from Biafra News Update's post,,,,,700,11.86

I just got a call from a colleague, he was complaining about a new Judiciary Appointment made by Buhari's Government that excluded the Igbos, but this guy in question used Nnamdi Kanu as his Phone wallpaper. Oga I'm not here to mince words, I'm here to ask just one question: You don't like Buhari in the first place, you hate Nigeria with Passion, why are you berived over the affairs and activities of Buhari's Government? Do we want Biafra or Nigeria? Can't we stand one place to see if Almighty God will have mercy on us?

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri. We are the descendants of Gad. Go to your history book and make your research. We (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/radiobiafra/photos/a.167711716743488/1629367160577929/?type=3,,,,,,,,651,3

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened. 3. Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 5. Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man, ignorance, stupidity, jealousy, envy and greed. 6. It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 7. Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 8. I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes . 19. There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 20. Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 21. Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". you see, this is how they roll. 22. That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away, that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 23. Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off, and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 24. Have you ever wondered, your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 25. Thanks to Radio Biafra, people are now listening and have started to reason. 26. Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 27. As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 28. When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 29. The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you. 30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday, and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course. 31.

Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man? 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine? 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37. On that note we have come to the end of this broadcast, as always, Biafra is our religion and on this platform Radio Biafra is where we worship, with all the love in me, from me, from here, it is Good evening COMPILED by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P)",https://www.facebook.com/tbrvglobal/photos/a.170541666976813/713735289324112/?type=3,,,,,,,,624,2.76

The nightmare of both PDP and APC adherents is Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. You see why I said those talking about Betrayal are enemies of the struggle. I knew from the start that this betrayal of a thing emanated from the control room of the politicians, and some of us that are too emotional couldn't see it....they jumped on it and started helping the enemy to yap betrayal. Those talking about Betrayal are pretending to love Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, but they hate him and want his movement destroyed. The aim is simple. Now that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is held illegally in prison, can we use this opportunity to destroy their leadership structure? If we can pretend to love Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and keep shouting that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was betrayed by people close to him. That People in IPOB high command betrayed him, some people will surely buy it, this will sow seeds of doubt among them and with it we can destroy them using them. Now that we in PDP will be taking over very soon. It is just remaining two years more and we will be cruising back to power. We can help APC to destroy IPOB, as we know that they are the only stumbling block we will be having. This is the current mindset of a PDP member. This is exactly why Reno is doing what he is doing presently. He has gone mad both on Facebook and on twitter. Reno is preparing for a PDP come back and what they care for is their pocket. Didn't I told you that like FFK like Reno. I don't know why some of us can't see all these things. No staunch PDP member is in love with a freedom fighter. Don't take them serious when they claim to be supporting you. They do that for an immediate gain. Not that they believe in what you are doing. Don't forget that the zoo you want to divide is the same place they want to rule. They are simply trying to use you to fight against APC. Should PDP takeover, they will do worse. Nigeria keeps getting worse, so they have learnt a lot from APC and they will implement them all. We must protect DOS with everything we got. DOS are collection of some few heads and they take decisions for us at this moment. They are hard core. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu didn't find them wanting, so you can't come out from no where to presume things you know nothing about. We must carry out their command to the latter. Don't let Reno or people like him to fool you. When he write something that trickle your fancy, take it, but have it in your mind that Reno is not your friend. APC and PDP are one and the same. No one betrayed Kanu. MNK's movement in and out of Britain is not a secret to British agencies. If any one wants to get Kanu's movement, he don't need a high IPOB member to reveal it to him. Don't let this guy use you ignite fire in his YouTube channel. Shameless people.

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA 1. An opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. For gathering against his children, the ZOO called Nigeria shall be destroyed 3. Nwike I want to ask you a question , was Obigbo on lockdown yesterday or not ? And where is Obigbo, is it not in Rivers State 4. Ask any banker you know in Igweocha, did you open for business ? 5. Because an order was given and they listened, the idiot came on Channels TV, he could not even sit well, Mrs. Tambowal 6. Parts of Rivers state was on lockdown , is it true or not ? 7. Our eternal leader, Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu must be happy with Ikonso where they are 8. And some of the Governors , including Obiano who built a cenotaph as well as Okowa we commend you 9. I want to also remember the interview Ikpazu had, it was commendable, including Dave Umahi he behaved like a man 10. I wont even mention the sariki of imo state , he is not even a Governor. He came out to challenge us and said that the lockdown will not hold but he was disgraced 11. That is why everything IPOB touches turns into gold. Today we are the most powerful mass movement in the world 12. Do you think that it's us that is doing it, its God almighty , that is why we give a command today and the whole world listens 13. The only people that did something decent is the vanguard newspaper 14. Tinubu thinks he can use the media to bamboozle all of us, that's what they do 15. There are some profession that does not suit black people , profession that requires honesty 16. Most of you does not know that Aguiyi Ironsi is from my clan, ibeku. The first battle field general 17. That is why history forgot about them because of their idiocy 18. It was Okpara economic miracle that frightened Britian , and that's why they organized the first coup 19. The first man that his regional economy supersedes that of the whole world 20. When we ask you to sit at home you must comply , it is for your own good and that of your family 21. And I must commend Obiano for building the cenotaph, very commendable 22. I said it yesterday and I want to say it again , Obiano, Umahi, Okowa they where all commendable 23. Imo state was not under lockdown, imo state was under chain, (ekere ya eke) 24. Anything is possible this days , do you know that men can become pregnant, maybe Nwike had a miscarriage, a man who sits on a chair like a woman 25. It is only in Africa that Pastors owes private Jets, but Pope who is the richest owes no private jet 26. Apart from Dele Giwa and few other journalist and Dele Momudu, the rest are they journalist ? 27. During a referendum you will only have one vote, even me Nnamdi Kanu I will have one vote 28. Nwike I want you to understand that Rivers state was created on 27th of May 1967. 29. That was the day Eastern consultative conference gave Ojukwu the mandate to declare Biafra, 27thMay 1967 that is. 30. People dont know why they call that day ""children's day "" as the British intelligence got the Intel that Ojukwu has been given the mandate to declare Biafra , they asked Gowon to divide them and rule, that was how Rivers state was created 31. Allow Nwike to continue deceiving all of you 32. Ojukwu asked , what shall we call this our new nation, and an Ijaw man called Frank Opigo said Biafra, and Ojukwu asked why Biafra? He whispered and said not here I will tell you later. 33. Ojukwu did not complain, and God was upon Ojukwu and he conceded and said this new nation shall be called Biafra 34. Nwike you dont know your history, you dont even know the history of your village 35. THE SOLDIERS ARE MOLESTING PEOPLE IN ABA RIGHT NOW, WHEN THE SAINTS REACT NOW AND SEND THEM TO GOD FOR JUDGEMENT YOU WILL COMPLAIN 36. Before the independent of the ZOO there where no identity crisis . 37. I ve always tried to proof to them that igbo race where Made up of three race . The house of Ephraim , 38. The reason why we keep having this debate is because our people are not educated, if you can take out few minutes to read the willins report , you will understand that our people are not educated 39. Head Bridge was closed down few days ago, the avenger came out and said they are going to blow up the oil pipe lines if they dont open it up 40. A white man said in 1968 , this people that inherbits the Plato of rivers, that we call Igweocha, you people are igbos, smart and energetic 41. These people they hate us because we are wise and hard working, that is why they brought Amed Gulaik to Owerri and killed him so that they can demonize us and Kill us all 42. They have been frustrating us so that we can ask them to give us five states and abandoned our brothers , but we said no we are going with our brothers 43.

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, Easterners will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",https://www.facebook.com/penchatnews/photos/a.100633975193990/264953758762010/?type=3,,,,,,,,546,1.22

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business. That is the ZOO for you. 39. The reason why what is happening about SARS is resonating 40.

Nwawube Ezeobi | The Biafra Post June 1, 2020 ▪️Introduction: Mazi Nnamdi Kanu offers super prayer in the language of heaven as he asks for heavens intervention as our enemies have gathered our land. He also assured heaven that Biafra will never worship any graven image or anything born of a woman. 1. We are going to start in a way people did not expect us to. We want to lay the background on how the zoo became decayed. That humanity will understand the enormity of the problem facing those living in Nigeria. 2. Our enemies are not sleeping, the traitors are not sleeping therefore we must not sleep. Our enemies are numerous. 3. Ali Ndume is a Fulani janjaweed politician, listen to what he have to say about Nigeria, the video is everywhere, from their we will proceed. 4. Our enemies who are within are using the name of Biafra, their aim is to delay the coming of Biafra in order to please their masters. We have discovered their tactics and we are ready to defeat them. 5. Ali Ndume said they deceived people, that they are not honest. He is telling you that all of them are bad including Nigerians themselves. 6. It is their job to decieve you, it is their job to make sure you have no education. It is their job to make sure you have no jobs. Nigerians instead of fighting for their freedom, are busy fighting those fighting for them. 7. We must not get discouraged. Our determination is unquestionable. 8. If you are wondering how evil a black man can be, Ali Ndume is a good pointer. Ali Ndume is a man accused of sponsoring Boko Haram. 9. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down as a people, that is the reason why it has been easy for the Fulani janjaweed to invade our land, kill us and divide us at will. 10. They will do whatever they can to make you feel what you are doing is not working but believe you me, we are holding them at a very bad place. 11. Britain started this very concerted effort to make sure that Biafra did not see the light of the day when they found out we are the descendants of Israel that will bring light to Africa. 12. Another problem that we have is Igbo man's love for gossip and affinity to back-bite which have to do with greed, envy and jealousy that is why you have Fulanis' in our homes, bushes and markets. 13. Before the Fulani janjaweed decided to take over our land, they bribed every major media house in the world, BBC and Co. Now that they are invading, have you heard about it anywhere in the world analyzing this influx into Biafra territory?. 14. There is a global effort not to allow Biafra to emerge and the Igbo man is not helping either. These are the issues concerning us as a people and it is my duty to let the world know of it. 15. There are many things we do not appreciate or understand, that is why when we preach we use historical references that when you listen, you can never doubt it. 16. Igbo man are their own greatest enemy, when the enemy is busy planning how to take over your land, you are busy gossiping, carrying envy and being jealous. 17. Saboteurs are hiding under the name Niger Delta to delay Biafra. Anybody referring to himself as a Niger Delta, God in heaven knows you are a traitor, their job is to distract us. To make you not to come together to articulate on how to get out of the mess you are into. 18. Biafra is the second most hated people in the whole world apart from Israel. People see you and they hate you for no reason. They see the favour of God on us and they hate us. 19. If you think you are safe, just know we are surrounded. 20. The more they reduce the numbers of our listeners on Facebook, the more I preach. You think this is 1967?. When our people were intimidated by the media, as Biafrans were being massacred, you were busy lying to the world using the media - BBC. 21. Nnia Nwodo and the rest of them never rose up to challenge the issue of artificial boundary by Gowon. 22. Chukwu Okike Abiama said Biafra can never come until you go and unite all my people together. 23. It was remaining only six more months to the Biafra war and we stopped during the war, President Nixton was about to step in but Chukwu Okike Abiama made it so. 24. Once you divide the land of Biafra, Elohim will depart from us his glory will never be with you. This is what our so called elders should have considered. 25. In Otaka village in Obubua Local Government Area in Cross River State they have four market days, they circumcise their children on the eight day. They celebrate new yam festival. 26. Not that we want to force anybody to join Biafra, but we must complete the assignment Heaven gave to us. He will have to shine his light in them so they decide where to belong. 27.

(3) Our people are very easy to be very cheap and that is only when you tell them the truth, they will then come out in mass to support you - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (4) Any day i wake up and did not pray for you or did not think about restoring Biafra, if Chukwu Okike Abiama did not take my life away i will know that he is not God - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (5) When i was arrested in 2015, my people blocked the river Niger bridge for completely 4 days, i didn't pay them they did it because am telling them the truth and they love me for that, i will surely never disappoint them because Biafra must be restored - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (6) Some of you are angry because we lifted the boycott and you don't have PVC, but you do not know that those who do not collect their PVC are the best reason why they signed our document - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (7) We held the Zoo by the balls and they signed our document, who tell you that Chukwu Okike Abiama is not great? - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (8) When the terms and condition they signed is published i assure you many of them will commit suicide, i assure you that - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (9) The zoo said they will kill me if i evangelize but the only courage i have is whenever i look back, my people are always with me that is my only courage - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (10) Know this tonight that i am nothing without IPOB family, you made me who i am today and i promise i will never let you down - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (11) If you are in this hall tonight you are very lucky because you are going to experience another dimension of this very struggle and will be counted among those that restored Biafra - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (12) I am not God but a human being who can make a mistake, but please when you want to correct me do it with love and emotion not with envy and jealousy or hatred - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (13) Some people are disloyal to my deputy Uche Mefor and i chased them out of IPOB because i respect everyone and hate disloyalty - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (14) I told England to support Biafra or great calamity befall them and they will never be called United Kingdom again - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (15) When i was in the prison i curse Nigeria don't you know that? If Britain did not rise up and support Biafra God will punish them, they will suffer - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (16) Orji Uzor Kalu visited me when i was in Kuje prison and asked me to drop Biafra agitation and i ask him how do you intend to liberate our people? He suggested that IPOB should form a political party so that we can win presidency, then i ask him to bring someone that i will surely support him and he refused, then i ask him do you see how the Zoo called Nigeria have eaten you people the so called the Igbo elites? - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (17) Nigeria Kangoroo court/government want to do to me what they did to Uwazuruike, tell me when to eat, when to talk, when to go to bed and when to wake up just to ruin our agitation, but i refused and went for evangelism mad people everywhere in the Kangaroo Nigeria - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (18) Why we did not retaliate the operation Python Dance is because the Zoo wanted to know the type of weapons IPOB have so that they will start killing our people in the North but we are always ahead of them, i asked my people not to attack but today Zoo is collapsing - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (19) I LIFTED THE ELECTION BOYCOTT FOR TWO THINGS ((20) 1. If we had gone with the boycott our land would have been divided, because our people are republicans in nature, they would have said Nnamdi Kanu do not take advice. (21) 2. They would have attributed all violence that happened to IPOB - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu There are so many people working and contributing towards the Biafra restoration that i don't even know, may Elohim bless you all they shall be a great reward for you all and it won't take long time ~ Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.

Nigerians, in particularly the old eastern region has disagreed with south east leaders’ position on their commitment to unity of Nigeria, saying they are speaking for themselves and not for the masses demanding referendum to settle Nigerian’s unity. NN News had reported that the delegation from the Federal Government led by the Minister of Defense, Retired Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi, met the Governors of the five States of the South East and other leaders of political, religious and traditional at the Government House, Enugu, reiterating their commitment to peace, unity and stability of the country. NN News gathered that, the people of the region argued that a referendum is the only option to settle the unity of Nigeria that the south east leaders’ position does not represent or speak for the masses, saying agitation of Biafra is not a crime But Chairman of the south east governor forum Engr. Dave Umahi stated that, the governors have agreed to articulate all the grievances and concerns of the people of the South East “as spelt out by the Ohanaeze Ndigbo”, saying: “We are happy that there is genuine willingness for further dialogue on such issues”. Gov. Umahi maintained that Ebubeagu is the only recognized local security outfit in the South East, emphasizing that “no other security outfit is speaking for South East and this is the position of Ndigbo”. According to him, “We are committed to one united Nigeria; we have always mentioned this; all our leaders are committed to this and that is why we read it everywhere, a united Nigeria of fairness, equity and equality of freedom and this we have further expressed. “Those who dish out hate speeches from our region, threat of violence or secession do not speak for South East. I repeat, we the South East people are not for secession, we don’t support it; we don’t call for it. Umahi noted that the stakeholders discussed issues on open grazing and that the delegates were in support of it. “We informed the delegates that each state of the region has laws in respect to the ban,”. According to some Nigerians on social media reads below; Joseph Okafor wrote; Then subject it to referendum , it’s not up to you politicians to decide Emmanuel Mbah wrote; Did southeast Leaders reject Fulanisation of the whole South, jihadist war to take our lands and present killings going on now? I believe that so call Leaders have taken bribe. Agitation of Biafra is not a crime. We have lost so many we can’t stop agitation until Biafra is restored. Chukwuemeka Anderson wrote; They are talking for themselves, and the people mind must be granted, you are there to speak the mind of people and not your own mind Prince Solomon Aham wrote; Referendum has been conducted on may 30th.. OYO Nwosu Nicholas wrote; You are all on your own 99% of our people says breakup Mamre Engr wrote; We the south east my foot , who asked you to say such a selfish thing you camelion” look at group of decevers , no problem we thank God that our youths has beginning to rise up to demonstrate and demand for what belongs to them, some of you that has betrayed us over the years will one day face the realities of your deeds , Alban Nweke wrote; Those southeastern leaders are not representing the entire southeasterns, they’re the problem we have in the southeast, they can remain in one Nigeria, because Nigeria has given them everything they need in life, we the masses will secede from Nigeria, they can relocate to the north. Onyinyechi Okere wrote; Don’t call them southeast because they’re not representing us just call them southeast politicians. Onyeke Koko Obg wrote; This is one problem with Black leaders. They can never represent and respect their people’s opinion perhaps because they rig themselves into power even when their people are dying for their freedom. IN a video interview,, Dave Umahi while speaking about ESN and herdsmen says: “…that is why the people seem to support them (ESN) while we the leaders don’t” If he claims to represents the people, is it not contrary to oath of office when he fails to represent their opinion? These men only represent themselves. People’s opinions don’t count. It is the way things are done in the Zoo. But the opinion of the people shall prevail. we shall teach them that we own them. We shall drag them to feel the ill wind faced by the masses. Chikaodili Ifediba wrote; Masses shall decide the fate of Biafra in NigerArea not looters and criminal minded individuals who see themselves as lords over others. Referendum is the option.

We are going to preach without prejudice. I will start this evening by dissecting the stupidity of an Igbo man. Do you want me to beg you, so you can defend your land?. Are you not foolish?. 2. We had a whole year to plan the war, until the war came, we start running around, five Million souls already layed dead. Same thing is happening now. 3. People are not cooperating, that is why only five thousand (5000), European men took over Africa. 4. Nzeogwu, Ironsi, and Azikiwe, they were all born in the feudal North, and fought for one Nigeria. 5. People don't want to associate with Arochukwu because of slavery, this is one of the reasons why God is angry with us. 6. Most of the settlements in Ikwerre are people sold into slaves and they were their till the end of slavery. 7. God anger have been with us for a long time. 8. Due to our individualism, we are where we are today. It is a very sober broadcast this evening. 9. They have tested their first Bomb in Imo State, two persons died. You know they installed their boy Hope Uzodimma there. 10. We are the miscreants but those who are doing the killings, Nnia Nwodo exonerated them. 11. Five million people died because there was no plan, the same thing that happened then is happening now, fifty solid years, Igbos have learnt nothing only claiming intellectuals. 12. A white man have shame, honour and integrity, black man have none that is the difference between a white man and a black man. 13. I begged you to donate one dollar each in Los Angeles, somebody asked why, I said it is because we need to prepare. Did you do it?. They were thinking if all of us contribute dollar each, Nnamdi Kanu will have millions now. Now Fulanis' are in your place. 14. Most of you in America are not spiritual, if you are you will know why Elohim sent you to America. 15. The love you have for your nation is the greatest love and your willingness to sacrifice to keep your nation progressing, not like the zoo. 16. Fulani Janjaweed went as far as Madagascar to bring drugs. 17. Every blessed day, Fulani Janjaweed is telling you, showing you they hate you. 18. Elohim will give us Biafra, what we will do to you people in America, the world will wonder, I say my thing laud and clear so that your envy will increase. 19. In 1967 we lost five million souls and in the year 2020, you are still doing the same thing. 20. Let me see anyone that say he is contesting for election, then you will buy rice and beans, today those you want to vote for you have their lives under threat and you can't do no anything 21. Every four years, they come out and ask you to vote for us and they will later stall whoever they like in Abuja. 22. I wonder what our ancestors will be thinking of you people right now. Serve your people and you are asking what you are going to gain. 23. In 2009 I told those in the north one day they will kill you and you will abandon all your properties. 24. Fulani hates you because Nzeogwu killed Ahamdu Bello. Nzeogwu was trying to save Nigeria. 25. Elohim please give us Biafra so we can set example with those stingy bastard in America. 26. They cannot learn from Kosovo and Armenia. 27. We are fighting for our freedom at the most difficult time, where there is no trust, the little trust left was destroyed by Uwazuruike. 28. Defending our land is a collective effort. You want me to beg you before you can rise up and defend your land. When George Washington was fighting for America, did he have to beg people to join?. That is the America you are enjoying. 29. There will be no movement on 30th May, atleast till its noon. 30. If you truly believe in something, I don't think anything anybody say will make you change your stand. 31. Our goal is simply to get Biafra. 32. You cannot see a Christian or Muslim renouncing their faith. People don't know that Biafra is a religion. 33. You said somebody insulted you and because of that you cannot fight for Biafra again but Almajiri have been in your village killing since 1945. Peter was crucified upside down in Rome, did it stop them?. 34. Once you defend them on the ground, Britain will give them aircraft to bomb you, we need weapons that can get down their aircrafts. 35. Any day they start killing and you retaliate, you will see them bombing your homes. 36. As we speak, Kaduna Christians are being massacred, the news broke out this evening. 37. Indigenous Christian communities in Southerner Kaduna, Seven [7] local government Area are being slaughtered. 38. An Igbo man in America is praying that the Fulanis' will come and kill us so he will come back and take the land belonging to the uncles wife. 39. There are Fulani native doctors in Ogbunike. Traitors in Ogbunike because of Money sold out (truncated)",http://www.thebiafrapost.com/2020/05/biafra-extracts-from-mazi-nnamdi-kanus_25.html,,,The Biafra Post: Biafra: Extracts From Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's Broadcast Of 24th May 2020 Via Radio Biafra,xxxxx,,,,483,3.93

When people started trending Simon Ekpa as the New Director of Radio Biafra, I was surprised at their ignorance. I asked myself how Broadcasting from Radio Biafra translate to being the Director of Radio Biafra. Even some PDP charlatans have started trending Ekpa as the New Leader of Radio Biafra. And they have started using propaganda against the young man. Let me also state it here that like many of us, Simon Ekpa was previously for a better Nigeria. Me too, there was a time I was writing and asking that Nigeria should restructure as the only way to sustain the country. I continued this, until I found out that Nigeria as a country can never get better. At least not with the Islamization and Fulanization agenda of the Fulani. The North sees Restructuring as handing over to the South. So it won't happen. I noticed this and hands up from the ignorance and stupidity called quest for Restructuring. Let me tell you here that those still shouting Restructuring are ignorant. So, you see, we all didn't wake up one day and started agitating for Biafra. We all have our stories and how Nigeria happened to us. Simon Ekpa was a political commentator before he joined IPOB. Simon was sympathetic to PDP and have written many works for PDP. Mr Ekpa lost interest in Nigeria and everything about Nigeria after the rigging in 2019. Simon couldn't believe it. He noticed, like I did many years ago that Nigeria is unsalvageable. He then launched what he called, changing the narrative of yesterday. This campaign saw Simo Ekpa starting to speak about Biafra. For him, Nigeria is gone and only Biafra can save us. When Mr Simon Ekpa started this new campaign, he was so real, but some of us have their doubts. So I personally commented on his wall, asking him never to change. I must say that till today, Ekpa have shown more dedication to Biafra restoration than any other thing he has ever embarked on. I am saying all these for you to understand exactly whom Simon Ekpa was before he joined the struggle. I am saying it because with his current position in IPOB, lots of propaganda will be coming from the desk of PDP members. I have warned our people to see PDP as same with APC. The two groups doesn't want Nigeria to divide, and can do anything to keep this corrupt center going. They two are your enemies. When you see them bring up videos or write ups Mr Ekpa made as a supporter of PDP some few years ago, please do disregard it. They are just trying to put doubt in you. Those that don't know should know it now that even our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was once in APGA. He once believed that with APGA, we can take over entire political structure in Biafra land and use it to move for Biafra independence, but he also found out that it can't work in a zoo. That's why he looked at people saying we should join politics, vote and elect those with Biafra mindset as jokers. He has been there and knows it can't work. I am happy to read the bellow clarification from Mr Simon Ekpa concerning the situation of things. Those questioning every directives of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are not true Comrades. They will keep writing trash, after which they will come to apologise. And I wonder why they are not tired of apology. Read this words from Mr Ekpa and be guided. Mr Ekpa will be broadcasting through Radio Biafra and not the New Director of Radio Biafra or Leader of IPOB. Hear Mazi Simon Ekpa... -------------------------------- ""Let me rhetorically state that there is no vacuum in the leadership of IPOB, there is no vacuum in the position of director of Radio Biafra. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu remain the Director of Radio Biafra and his directive is final as we maintain the command and control. Our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will continue to lead the struggle from where ever he is, be it in the prison, DSS custody, police detention or from AsoRock detention. The directive of our leader on the 8th of July 2021 is that I, Simon Ekpa should start broadcasting from Radio Biafra with immediate effect, to maintain the legacy and sustain the momentum of the movement, a task I accepted without hesitation because the situation requires extra ordinary media war to sustain, expose the impunity of the Nigeria State, to expose the genocide and end the enslavement of indigenous people in Nigeria in a different level. Whoever have issues with this should check him or herself. The directive of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is not just a wish, it is an order. I am Simon Ekpa, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s disciple on Biafra restoration. On this day, 10.7.2021."" ---------------------------------- Dearest Simon Ekpa, know it that we support you. Also know it that every body must not like you.

Even though I know they can't do anything. I did not in any way hate Christianity or am I fighting against Christianity. Anyone seeing it as such should tell me if I am not a Christian myself. I am simply saying that anyone in IPOB championing a one week One Nigeria Christian sit at home is a distraction to us. As far as Nigeria is concerned, no protest done under the umbrella of Christianity will work. It is only but a fruitless venture. If you want to get yourself unnecessarily busy, I will understand, but for you to be seriously thinking you will use Christianity to give the zoo a fight, then you are a joker. The only way you can use it is to expose the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria. But these same Christians are so fragmented that they can't put up one front. How do you detache these people from their pastors? How do you make catholics to come together with Anglican? How do you make Adebayo to stand in solidarity with a jet pastor against the government? Some of these men are mega pastors that feed fat on the corruption ravaging Nigeria. Some of these men of God do nothing other than launder money for these politicians. You think they will just watch and see you destroy their empire? You think so? They are the men that always come to give vision that Nigeria won't divide, whenever the people pushes harder. Give them money and they will dismiss their own people with one fake prophecy. You are already a failure when you fight this evil under Christianity. You are Christians, yet tribes and interest is still holding us all down. Nothing you do under One Nigeria will work. Let people rise as a people. When Fulanii herdsmen attacks a community, they don't ask if you are a Christian or not. They attack a people. They will ki""ll both traditionalists and atheists alike. No one is safe. If you keep pushing for one Nigeria Christian sit at home, then you are now fighting a Nigeria fight. You are uniting Nigeria and working indirectly for One Nigeria. If Middle Belt must rise up, they must rise up as a people and not as Christians. We rose up as Biafrans, and not as Christians, Jews, traditionalists or atheists. Oduduwa people rose up as a people and not as Christians or Muslims. When you push for Christians in Nigeria, you are setting us Backwards. I have said enough. But let me say it again that there will never be any Christian sit at home and even if you secure a date, it will be a resounding failure. One Nigeria don't have what it takes to do that. We should not in any way waste our time campaigning for what won't happen. Tell middle belt that we have already an ongoing protest against the jihadist, let them join the Monday voluntary Sit at home. We can't suspend anything to champion or carry their matter for head. Or if they can't join, they should at least give us a date for the sit at home they called for. They already know we are ever ready. So the ball is on their call. Avoid distraction. Do not start a One Nigeria Christian struggle. You are reinvigorating Nigeria with it. That name is a curse. It doesn't exist. It should be killed.

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business. That is the ZOO for you. 39. The reason why what is happening (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/Biafranupdate/photos/a.2027620727558017/2790789671241115/?type=3,,,,,,,,402,-3.89

Ndiokwere) PREAMBLE: WHO IS THE RIGHTEOUS ONE? Who is a saint? Who is without sin; let him throw the first stone! Most Religious people, including the Popes and canonized saints, great Educationists, Professors, great Inventors, Politicians and World leaders – living or alive - have never been known to be free of sin. Some are even known to have served prison sentences for various ‘crimes’ before they became world figures! Few Nigerian political and religious leaders, past and present, are known to be ‘saints’. Just a few, if any at all, who must have made notable contributions towards the welfare of their people still enjoy a comfortable place in history books! Can we award marks on ‘merit’ to the prominent few we still remember their names in the field of politics in Nigeria? Nnamdi Azikiwe – Zik of Africa, Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Saduana of Sokoto, Tafawa Balewa, Shehu Shagari, Goodluck Jonathan, Obasanjo (civilian) and Muhammadu Buhari (civilian)? Surely ALL OF THEM have/had big DENTS on their character, and surely just few Nigerians speak well of them. They have all big dents! I am sure if human beings can shun prejudices, and speak the truth, not one of the former and present Nigerian leaders may score up to 20% mark. On the State level – Eastern states, as an example: Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibiam, Ukpabi Asika? Jim Nwobodo, Orjiuzor Kalu, Theodore Orji, Samuel Onunaka Mbakwe? Ikedi Ohakim, Rochas Anayo Okorocha, Emeka Ihedioha, Hope Uzodimma - All have big terrible Dents. Perhaps only SAMUEL MBAKWE may score above 40%! History supplies verifiable facts and figures. MAZI NNAMDI KANU – THE FORMER ALLEGED ‘CROOK’ You may like MNK, hate him, agree with him, disagree; it is becoming clearer that History may at last identify the guy as an indomitable Black-African patriot and freedom fighter after Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela, among former ‘rebels’ who played a great role in the struggle for the liberation of their people from slavery and bondage. Those who hate Kanu, including his fellow Igbos, write all sorts of trash to discredit IPOB movement and their leader. Look at the type of stuff they write and circulate: “Nnamdi Kanu was once a scammer, 419-er, a fake”….! No problem. The big question: “What do these enemies of progress hope to achieve by this campaign of calumny? ‘Allegations’, True or False; that WAS in the past; ‘HE WAS…’, ‘MNK used to be….’ But today he is “Born-Again”, intelligent, sensible, and full of wisdom, and speaks the truth. He is alive today working for the freedom of his people. Why join your enemies to block your freedom and that of generations to come? GOOD LEADERS MAKE SACRIFICES Surely MNK has the largest followers among all Igbo leaders today, and these are not ‘idle useless mob’. However MNK may not be ‘Superhuman’ and without dent; but his case is surely that of a lone voice in the wilderness! What do you expect from his people! The Bible confirms that a prophet is not acknowledged in his own village, among his own people. What will MNK lose more in Nigeria, when the Cabal, aided by Igbo traitors tried to get rid of the young man in a Historical “Python Dance?” They massacred so many youths and as well brought about the untimely death of his parents. He escaped death because of the presence of some Biafran soldiers in Nigerian military. If I were MNK I will not give up this struggle, come what may. I will face death and join my dead parents where they are! But let posterity take records. MNK AND THE ZOO REPUBLIC Many ‘educated’ Nigerians do not like MNK primarily because of his ‘language’. But how can you blame the young man, when in a “Democratic country”: (1) The IDENTITY of the President has been under contention for over 3 years now? But I do not admire how the ‘investigation’ of this ‘mystery’, ‘allegation’ is going on! It should NOT be Nnamdi Kanu or any private journalist, foreign or local, who should tell the world the ‘Truth’ of the Matter. It is part of Nigerian History today that ABBA KYARI is dead and buried. Period! Documented, publicly and officially confirmed by “competent” government authorities. The historical records are in the archives. (2) The ‘allegation’ that Buhari is dead and buried in Saudi Arabia since 2017 sounds FUNNY! What should be the “very important reason/s” for Buhari family to hide the death of their father? In a matter of life and death event, is it a Political Party or Government in power that makes public the death of a family member? Is the reason for the Cabal to remain in power till the end of the world enough to frame a ‘conspiracy theory’ surrounding the identity of a Head of State, and to choose or CLONE a non- Nigerian from Sudan, and name him (Dead) Buhari? Does the Cabal need such irresponsible, stupid, ‘rigorous procedure or tactics’ to retain power?

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",https://www.facebook.com/Biafranewsmill/photos/a.1948335488771671/3146673105604564/?type=3,,,,,,,,377,2.58

If they buy you a gold, you might not care for it, simply because you don't know the worth. Same thing is applicable to freedom. You must fight for freedom, so you can treasure it. Ndị Igbo have given it all for freedom. Another group of youths that have given it all are Akwaibom youths. These youths were there in 2017 when Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's house was attacked by Nigeria military. They came down to Nkpor too and some paid the ultimate prize. I also watched some pictures of Akwaibom indigenes that were locked up in Nigeria prison because of Biafra. Because they were IPOB members, they were starved by prison wardens to the extent that they looked exactly like Kwashiorkor patients. It is the prize for Freedom that drives patriotism. Without it you will get freedom and mess it up. The Biafra we seek will never be like Nigeria. It won't be one federal feeding bottle system of government. Biafra will comprise of nations. A people united in purpose. We shall know our differences and treasure it. There will be no shouts of one Biafra, for Biafra is a coming together of many nations. In this Biafra you will make your laws and in your own language. You will take charge of your resources and control commerce. Your local language can be elevated to become your means of communication. And you can chose to exit Biafra at anytime through a referendum. I am not making this up. I have heard the IPOB leader say them. This means that no one will build your own part of Biafra for you except you. I used the last sit at home to determine the level of acceptance for our freedom. And I found out that Ijaw as a people are still lagging behind in terms of setting themselves free from this zoo. Some of their youths are still engrossed with politics and listening to politicians that have looted them dry. These politicians lie to them that Igbo is their problem, while they keep looting them. There is every need to teach every Ijaw child to understand that there is no hope for him or her in Nigeria. Judging from the last sit at home, I can tell you that the average Ijaw man is still far from embracing freedom. And this is pathetic. Those of them fooling themselves about Niger Delta Republic of entire South South should wake up already. I even wonder why no one is actually fighting for Niger Delta Republic, no leader, no protest, but once any of them hears Biafra, they will remember Niger Delta Republic. You must understand that Nigeria in other to downsize the Igbo people carved them into what they called South South. I watched these Igbo people from Rivers, Delta to Benue observe last Monday Sit At Home. This will tell you that all Igbo people are united in Biafra. I am not saying you can't have your Niger Delta Republic, you can have it, but you have to stop dreaming of having Ndị Igbo in it. You can't love part of Ndị Igbo and hate some. You can't love Ngozi from Egbema in Rivers State and hate Ngozi from Egbema in Imo State. It is never down. You can't fight this alone. Don't say when Igbo people leave, then you will start your own agitation. They won't let you. You must start now to stand for something. You must stop listening to these wicked and selfish leaders. Lies is what they tell you. Igbo youths had to depart from the their leaders before they saw light. You must do the same. If you need your own Nation, it is more feasible in Biafra. Don't wait to be begged. Don't wait to be consulted, for no one consulted anyone of us. And no one will Bribe you to accept freedom. Thank God MNK said it already that every nation in Biafra will vote differently during referendum. Meaning that those that say they are not Biafrans will have the opportunity to vote themselves out. Come Monday 16th, we will again observe another referendum and you will agree with me that Igbo people both in South East and South South have decided that it is Biafra or Biafra.

We know what it has caused the nation and we know it isn’t over yet.""",https://www.facebook.com/radiobiafra/photos/a.167711716743488/1643274635853848/?type=3,,,,,,,,333,-1.35

They are always dub-ious and have the resources to carry out any project. Be it bad or good. Do you remember Don Wanny of Omoku Rivers State? He was friend of politicians. They used him to commit many dirty things as to win elections. But when they are done, they hunted him down to Enugu and killed him for something they got no evidence that he committed. They didn't stop there. They also went after his brother and killed him in cold blood in front of his children. The government is facing IPOB now. Lots of things are going on. Mr Ekpa works for this politicians. His job is to use his dubious charismatic way to fool some IPOB followers, then recruit some crimiinals who will do the dirty job for him. The government will be far behind giving him the required resources. There are some people on ground that are ready to do anything provided money is involved. There are also some emotional fools that embraced the struggle. These guys are so emotional that they lack reasoning and tact. They are ready to work for Mr Ekpa because they think and believe the zoo needs to be taught a lesson. They mistake teaching the zoo a lesson with terro-rising their own people. They will aid the destruction of the same struggle they so much cherished. The aim of recruiting Mr Ekpa by the government is to help make the people hate the movement. The greatest problem facing Nigeria government is the fact that almost 90% of Ndị Igbo are pro IPOB. This needs to be punctured. And how can this be done. By terro-rizing the people in the name of freedom, IPOB and Biafra. There is a limit to what the people can take. The story of freedom is always beautiful, but the journey is always painful. Remember the Israelites on their way out of Egypt? They all were happy to leave Egypt at first, but on the way they faced difficulties and murmured against God and Moses. They wished to go back to Egypt and suffer than face what they are presently facing in the name of going to the promise land. Nigeria government desperately need the people of Biafra to turn against this very struggle and that is the job of Mr Ekpa. They will continue to terro-rize the people to the extent that the people will rise up against their own freedom. Don't forget that many are not registered IPOB members but they are fully in support of IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Imagine a situation where Mr Ekpa's gangs on ground starts terro-rising them that they start working against the struggle. This will Isolate the registered members to the extent that they will go underground or even denounce their struggle. Remember that many hard cores are already struggling. Some lost their jobs and many are on the run, changing from state to state. Soon we won't be only running from the wicked government agents, but from our dear brothers, no thanks to Mr Ekpa. They will even go after those writing for IPOB that are on ground. The worse thing is that those Mr Ekpa is using will be flushed out by the government like they did to Don Wanny immediately they achieve their purpose. And Mr Ekpa who is a citizen of another country will forever live happily with the money paid to him. Do you understand what I am saying? I don't really know why I am still writing and risking my safety for those that are not listening. The moment we started fighting the leadership of IPOB and command and control was the time we started endangering our lives and the life of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Don't forget that the master said he won't disappoint you, but you will disappoint him. He also turned around to tell someone not to allow Satan enter him. I will end it here. They will try, but they won't see us. And most importantly, they will fail. Elochukwu Ohagi, Philosopher, Teacher and Activist, 2022.",,,,,,,,,326,0

Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's comment on Nigerian pastors and Imams is simply a wake up call and not an insult or hate speech. If you are a pastor and you are doing the right thing, then that message is not for you. We know that there are good Men of God, but they are very few and their voices are not loud enough to change the status quo. We need more voices to speak up! If half of the Nigerian pastors can stand up today and say enough is enough, believe you me things will become normal in the zoo. But unfortunately, what we have are bunch of hypocrites romancing with the bad leaders. During election period, pastors in Nigeria are seeing using their pulpit to project bad politicians after collecting huge amount of money from them. Is that what real men of God are known for? Even Jesus Christ whom they claim they are following his footsteps never dinned with the bad leaders/politicians during his days. He rebuked them and told them their sins in their faces and some of them repented while others sought to eliminate him. This is what righteousness is all about, speak the truth and dam the consequences. Nigerian pastors are too afraid to speak the truth, instead they are friends with the corrupt leaders. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu only told them the bitter truth so that they can wake up from their slumber and start doing what they ought to be doing. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu should be commended not condemned. He is doing what everyone is afraid to do. If you do good, IPOB will be your friend. Don't forget, a certain Rev father heavily criticized your principal Dr Goodluck Jonathan who was even doing better and projected the tyrant we are seeing today. Ironically, that same man of God is no longer speaking despite the glaring evil and injustice going on in the contraption called Nigeria. Is that the kind of people you want us to respect? Hell no! Truth must be spoken, it doesn't matter whose horse is gored. We are IPOB!

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR RADIO AND BIAFRA TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Baifran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35. Things are now happening in ZOO and I thank Chukwu Okike Abiama for that. 36. People that kept your name away from the people that suffered Genocide, are they going to love you ? 37. Ask yourself why did Britian swore that Biafra will not arise, they said over their dead bodies and that is why Britain will be divided. 38. I commend the Oduduwa agitators for coming out today to campaign in London. 39. In this era of Big brother, the indomie people forget so easily. 40.

All of you have abandoned what happened in Imo state and you are facing something different. 8. Our madness is coming, you have not seen nothing yet. 9. I was in Zoo court and I called Buhari a mad man. 10. Obasanjo, former president was holding a meeting with Shaikh Gumi. 11. Shaikh Abubakar Gumi the bandit envoy is the chief negotiator for the l so called presidency. 12. I have warned my Yoruba brothers, don't allow yourself to be used by this people. 13. When they first settles, the Yoruba journalist should be held accountable. 14. You thought you are doing IPOB and Biafra, but today Fulani are in your forest. 15. Why is it that when you write about Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram you don't use the word prescribed? But when you write about IPOB you use prescribed? 16. Only Biafra can save all of us. 17. How about that old traitor, Edwin Clark. An old African man answering a white man's name. 18. Shaikh Gumi, the same man that said Boko Haram is a blessing is now the peace maker between Boko haram and the Zoo. 19. That tells you that every security apparels in the Zoo is set to Islamise you. 20. I ask you animal that call yourself Nigerians, does it mean that your brain cannot put one and two together. 21. By the time I am done with these animals, their wives will not cook for them again. 22. How many times have you heard that their homes and towns in the north were attacked with gun boat and air bombardment, only in the south. 23. May the unknown gun men locate you. 24. Some of you animals in the Zoo does not even know what is the work of the army in the Zoo. 25. Let me educate all you Zoo animals. The duty of the army is to defend the borders of the country. 26. People wrote about it in the time of Jonathan that the Yorubas are marginalized, but right in front of you Fulani has maginalised you. 27. God almighty will bear me witness, the ZOO WILL FALL. 28. The same Fulani that hate the security Outfit is heading every terrorist outfit in the Zoo. 29. Dear Nigerians, when will this your Stupidity and idioticy leave your brain or where you born this way? 30. Once you say your a Nigeria you're an animal 31. I want the Fulani JANJAWEED to understand that what we are doing is backed up by Torah and Quran. 32. Aisha wrote and said ""I myself Aisha , I don't travel abroad for clinic because Aso Rock clinic is in good shape. 33. Then the idiot started writing to the king of Jordan that you are on vacation. 34. Why are you writing to the king of Jordan? Because Aisha caught you out. 35.

GOD WILL PUNISH YOU ALL THE OPERESSORS. 37. Anything they say you jump, anything they ask you to do you do it , because you are under Fulani tyranny. 38. Fulani understands this, that among the victims of python dance, there is always one person that will rise up and say, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. 39. I told you there will be no road blocks on Biafra land and I am giving this order again tonight. ANYWHERE YOU SEE A ROAD BLOCK, OR ARMY CHECKPOINT DESTROY IT 40. IF YOUR SON, OR BROTHER IS AMONG THOSE WHO COMES OUT ON THE ROAD ALONG IHIEALA ROAD IF WE CATCH YOU , YOU WILL DIE !!! 41. Anywhere you see road block in our land DESTROY IT. 42. BBC IGBO, BBC IGBO!! ONE DAY YOU WILL HEAR IT. 43. Our crime in IPOB, is that defend our people. 44. Where were you all idiots when they came to my home to kill me. 45. That madness Fulani is looking for they will find and Britain will never save you. 46. If you don't rise up now Fulani will take over your land. 47. Yoruba listen to me, fulani have perfected a way to take over your land, your journalist is ashamed to talk about it, the same Shame has caught up with DAVE UMAHI. 48. When they accuse IPOB every newspaper will carry it, but when Boko haram kills or army kills then it is ""allegedly "" 49. EASTERN SECURITY NETWORK 10, 000 men under arms, these are those in the forest . 50.

Pissed with the way things are going in the British zoo called Nigeria, the young man who is identified as Ken Chuks Agboeze, otherwise known as Mr Xgentle, said: “I gave up on this thing totally and swore to never reconsider it the day they boldly looked people in the eyes and alleged that an animal swallow a huge amount of money. Again, another and another animal came to have their share of the money too. To an extent, a rodent as common as rat, kept their supposed number 1 man out of office for weeks. The So-called academic professors rigged in an incompetent ""dead"" illiterate back to power. Senators cannot hold brilliant discussion. And worse still, the so called educated guys still defend these people, fighting others for their sake, and selling their children's future while still claiming to be educated. I don't know for you, but I swear I'm in no way a Nigerian, never was. Before you remind me of my ID Card, remember that the Israelites 400 years in Egypt never ever meant they were Egyptian. So I am not a Nigerian even though I am trapped herein. If I get there, I’ll sue anyone who addresses me as a Nigerian. From its inception, there's no good thing about Nigeria; nothing, especially their morals. And I, Mr Xgentle, hate to identify with moral bankruptcy. Even if it doesn't come fully in my time, I'm a Biafran, not a Nigerian.

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25. I do not (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/1706840086286828/photos/a.1706845949619575/2296534403984057/?type=3,,,Timeline photos,,,,,308,7.51

SHABBATH SHALOM GREAT BIAFRANS! KING JAMES VERSION (KJV). Psalms 139:1-24(BIAFRA WAY) 1. O LORD, thou hast searched me, Nnamdi Kanu, and known me. 2. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 3. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. 4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 5. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. 6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. 7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 8. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea (in Great Britain); 10. Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me (in Kenya); even the night shall be light about me. 12. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. 13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 15. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 16. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. 17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. 19. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked (saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies), O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 21. Do not I hate them (Nigeria), O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: 24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. Iseeee iseeee iseeee. #song. 1.

Jehovah na adị ndụ, Jehovah na adị ndụ! Ewoo; Asi na m eje ije na ndaraogwugwu ọnwụ, Jehovah na adị ndụ! Let us pray. We thank Thee Oh God our Father for your immeasurable love towards us. We will forever worship and adore Thee because there is none like Thee. From everlasting to everlasting You remaineth the same. We thank Thee for your servant and our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who You created for the purpose of restoration of Biafra and put in him a different Spirit that no man can lure him to disobey your instructions and commandments. We thank You Lord because nothing happens to him and your people Biafrans without your knowledge. Who will say and it comes to pass when you have not given approval? For only your counsel concerning Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans shall stand. Hence the conspiracies of Saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies are broken in pieces and can never stand. Therefore any one who has a hand in the illegally abduction of Nnamdi Kanu is used to fulfill your purpose and will die as Judas Iscariot. They will all be brought into thy judgement seat and will never escape death, for their iniquity is full. Our Father and our God Chukwu Okike Abiama, we know that your ways are different from man's ways and your thoughts are higher than ours, therefore we trust in Thee to deliver our leader and Biafra Nation your own way. Daniel never knew that lions would not eat him up, he resigned to death, but Thou delivered him by the same king who threw him there. Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego didn't know that the fire would not consume them; but Thou sent your son into the fire to prevent the same fire that burned up those who threw them there from hurting them. We can go on and on to recount thy wonderous works and we are sure that You will fulfill your promise to your servant Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans. The Zoo and Britain do not have what it takes to jail or kill your servant because you have the final say. We are waiting patiently Oh Lord for our leader to rejoin us and together we will sing and praise Thee in Biafra Nation as he said. We commit the ESN, DOS, Legal team, Media warriors, various departments of IPOB family, those who are still incarcerated in various prisons and all genuine Biafrans into Your hands, to uphold us till the (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/100694331787338/photos/a.100705055119599/373658584490910/?type=3,,,,,,,,277,-1.5

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I dont belive in the ZOO called nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he has I LOVE JESUS AND IM PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. I.G.B.O is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable , the igbo is a very very stubborn race , to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us Previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger , and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested , the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as thr so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previ to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers , but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother , how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm , please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do ? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed , that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school , did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even come onto the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries , refine it there and bring it back to you , tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37.

Our progenitors started democracy, Britain, said they have no history, when they were messing themselves about in Nsukka ,i said to my father i want to go to England to study, he asked me why do you want to go to England and study ? i said because that is the sources of our problem, and for us to find the solution we must go to the source of the problem and deal with it. That's how we came to this very place, and believe me we have found the solution and we are applying it this very day, therefore i said to all of you who are gartherd around your listening devices this evening that Biafra is imminent, and there is nothing i repeat there is nothing our enemies can do about it. i want to start this program, this very evening by playing a very short clip for you. What white people are saying about you that you do not know. We are all Biafrans every Biafran clans are igbo, allow me to repeat because igbo means the ancient people, (Ndi gboo) The very oldest people in the face of the earth, the very ancient people, i need you to understand this very very clear , everything i preach in radio Biafra is the truth, irefutable, Because everything i tell you must come to pass, i say MUST. i want to play for you, what white man said, those who are studying the supreme court judgment in our program this evening, i will dissect it this evening.i will cut it open for the world , i will shame the sharia supreme court of the zoo, that the world will understand how foolish they are, That the judiciary that you have been subjected to is a worst fraud than APC goverment , Because the people do not want to shake up their ignorance, and i also want to remind you why black people was taken out for slave all over the world, and why the black race was the only race that were marketed like an industrious comodity all over the world, why was that ? any day the blacks start asking themselves why they were the only race that was marketed like comodities all over the world that day, is when they shall start profering solution to that, love us or hate us, we shall speak the truth, you can run around, but eventually you must come to term to the position of IPOB, i am giving you the news as it was reported by zoo news paper , in case you are wondering where is the zoo? The zoo is Nigeria because it was not created, through black people or through conquest, but through British, some body came all the way from britain and say you, you and you from today your name is Nigeria , and your flag is green white and green. And they started jumping up like the monkeys they are, they say i insult them but i do not insult them, but if you believe in Nigeria you are less than an animal , sit down and think about it in a logic way, how many black people went to europe to go and create a country in Europe or America ? it's only in Africa, because you suffer from an inferiority complex, You need a white man to create a country for you, You need a white man to organise you before you can be a human being, that's why you are in a zoo called Nigeria because you cannot reason, i can catigorically assure you that person is not educated enough, why are things happening in Nigeria the way it is happening today ? why is it happening ? ask your self why it is happening? ""O' there is terrorism in Bauchi, they have killed somebody in Gombe, There are kidnnapers along Zaria Kaduna road , O we no longer pass through Abuja to Kaduna, O God help us o In jesus name God help us oo . you run to your local Pastors maybe is Suileman or maybe is Mbaka of this APC priests , They will say o it is by the grace of God they didn't kill you , mean while you have only 2000 naira in your porcket, they will tell you o oya bring it to sow seed to thank God, for saving your life and you will foolishly obey, because you are African and you are very very stupid.",https://www.facebook.com/Chibuking11/photos/a.1014284625435894/1231374190393602/?type=3,,,,,,,,256,8

Another thing I want you to understand is, you see this BIAFRA Republic we are fighting for, it means so much to us. It means LIFE AND DEATH to us. So, anybody that comes against it, or comes in between us and this BIAFRA to stop us from getting it or to destroy it, oh God have mercy on you, we will never spare you no matter who you are. It doesn't matter what good you might have done in the past, we will collectively fight you and stop you. I want everyone to also know that, as we are praising you today for doing well in this BIAFRA struggle, anyday, you allow the praises to enter into your head and you think you have arrived and begin to talk nonsense against Biafra, IPOB or join forces with the enemy, with the Nigerian government, Ohanaeze, Igbo governors/corrupt politicians against BIAFRA, IPOB and the liberation of your people, oh God still have mercy on you, we will not remember any good you might have done in the past because your present evil deeds have cancelled your good, the same way we praised you and stood by you is the same way we will come against you and fight you to a stand still until you either repent or you disappear and leave us alone to liberate you since you have nothing good to offer. Again, this BIAFRA freedom means life and death to us. Don't go against it if you want peace to reign between us and you. If you have nothing good and meaningful to contribute, shut up your mouth and watch us. I am a very peaceful and quiet person, but I HATE EVIL AND INJUSTICE WITH PASSION. I am an advocate for the best life for everyone. Ndi Igbo atala ahuhu na obodo Nigeria and they MUST BE FREE whether anybody like it or not. Then, when Biafra comes, everybody will rejoice and celebrate; and we will come back to Biafra Land and the real work of building a first class country will begin. BUT, we will still not allow anybody to derail the country we fought so hard to get, to turn it to be like Nigeria or have any resemblance of ZOO Nigeria in it. But if you think you can derail it, then that time, I will not be talking to you or fight you on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube alone, I will come to your office or wherever you are and talk to you face to face. I want the best life for everyone. God has given me a powerful and influential voice to speak in his behalf on Earth against evil and injustice, and that is why I can't keep quiet in the face of evil and injustice, even If I want, I can't.

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened. 3. Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 5. Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man, ignorance, stupidity, jealousy, envy and greed. 6. It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 7. Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 8. I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes . 19. There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 20. Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 21. Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". you see, this is how they roll. 22. That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away, that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 23. Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off, and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 24. Have you ever wondered, your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 25. Thanks to Radio Biafra, people are now listening and have started to reason. 26. Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 27. As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 28. When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 29. The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you. 30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday, and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course. 31.

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25. I do not need to be diplomatic when am (truncated)",http://www.thebiafrapost.com/2020/04/biafra-extract-from-mazi-nnamdi-kanu_19.html,,,The Biafra Post: Biafra: Extract From Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Broadcast On The 18th Day Of April 2020,xxxxx,,,,238,1.93

Some will still hate you and run you down. This time have taught me better. That not all truly want a Biafra away from Nigeria. Let me tell you the truth. Many rich men both in government and markets in Igbo land don't want Biafra to come. Nigeria as a country give them chance to make huge illegal money. How can you expect a governor in Nigeria that can squander money for 8 years and nothing will happen to want Biafra to be restored. After the squandering, he will go on to win senatorial seat and continue the looting from there. What of a business man that goes to China to request for substandard goods? What of the fake producer of wine in our markets distributing cancer to our people and making huge amounts of money? What of the criminals on our roads masquerading as policemen? What of the immigration officers in our airports collecting 100 dollars from first time travelers? What of the rapists and killers of youths masquerading as Nigeria soldiers? These guys are money bags and they are all out to end this struggle. They have the money and they are doing their best to end it. Biafra is what Nigeria can't be. The duty of these people is to either end IPOB or hand it over to them so that Biafra can become more evil and useless than their Nigeria. These people have bought over criminals that subscribed to IPOB thinking they can make money from it. Some IPOB members thought what IPOB is doing is to end today's oppressors and become tomorrow's oppressors. This was how MASOB derailed. They gave themselves governors of localities and turned themselves gods. They started bullying and extorting money from our people. Their reputation killed and gradually they died a natural death. These dubi-ous men joined IPOB too. They were thinking that when Biafra is restored, they will just be given positions that will allow them to steal. A true freedom fighter must understand that the end game is freedom. He must be ready to be willing to restore Biafra and enthrone laws that will guide every body, and turn the Biafra leader into a people's servant. This is the Biafra of our dreams. Not a Biafra you behave any how, act anyhow and lord it over others. It is not a Biafra you turn yourself into a god simply because you won ordinary governorship election. The sponsors of the infiltrators are the dubi-ous politicians, corrupt businessmen and women. They have recruited criminals among us to try and destroy what we are doing. These criminals will always shout that they are standing on the truth, but can't be proud to say or mention that truth they are standing on. They cannever be proud of that truth. I tell you this day. You must not succumb to them. Anyone telling you to make peace with them is your enemy. No infiltrator or supporter of infiltrators is your comrade. You must see them as worse than the oppressors. You must rise up against them. IPOB must take record of all of them supporting this madness and send them packing. No infiltrator must be allowed into any position in IPOB. Not even the position of a floor member. By so doing, you are not only protecting the struggle, you are also protecting and safeguarding the lives of our people. Every genuine IPOB member should understand that it is you against these criminals. I tell you this always. A hungry man is not just someone that is not rich. Most rich people in Nigeria are actually hungry. You can be rich or poor and still be hungry. This is why Nigeria politicians upon all their riches are still looting. This is why they were able to buy over lots of them abroad, and they contacted some of them in the zoo and rendered them one or two help and they sold their conscience. We must be careful. We must protect this struggle from these criminals. They might hate you today, but they will soon be defeated. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be released. He will chastise those that became indiscipline. He will maintain the sack of all the dubi-ous infiltrators. He will not give room for what happened this time to happen again. And finally, those that stood strong to defend this struggle will be celebrated as heroes.

We have received the information of our leader's abduction by Nigeria government and their allegations leveled against our leader. We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",https://www.facebook.com/BARONAJIKEMEDIAN/photos/a.101194728807538/127860299474314/?type=3,,,,,,,,226,3.83

But nothing happened till the next day. Those trapped under the collapsed building were all left to die. I tell you that you have no government. You have men who will always go to Abuja to get allocations they will squander. The fire service vehicle from Anambra can't dispatch its water. People have to help out with buckets. The same thing happened when thank explosion happened in Upper Iweka. It has always been Asaba to the rescue. If you are comfortable with these useless governments in Nigeria, then you must be an accomplice or gullible. You are at the mercy of God. It is zero protection from your government. That's why you will always die due to bad roads and say that's how God wants it. Do you mean to say that it is God that is killing you and not your wicked government?

It is a vast land housing lots of different people. People of different ideologies and cultures. People that so hate themselves to the extent that they kill themselves. Yet some people are telling you that they will rescue Nigeria. When are you going to stand firm against these criminals masquerading as leaders? When? Both France, America and many other countries you are rushing to all underwent revolution before they changed things. Support revolution, support Biafra.

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU!

We have received the information of our leader's abduction by Nigeria government and their allegations leveled against our leader. We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with Southwest by Amotekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the South East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is a right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will lose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to lose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, Lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. The Buhari administration was not able to stop BOKO HARAM and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labeling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteer groups and how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is asking for. Let the international community know that as of today 2nd of July 2021. ESN is still an ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested in stopping the insecurity the Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, the South East will never tolerate it. Let the international community also know that the Buhari administration wants to turn us into an uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.

Some will still hate you and run you down. This time have taught me better. That not all truly want a Biafra away from Nigeria. Let me tell you the truth. Many rich men both in government and markets in Igbo land don't want Biafra to come. Nigeria as a country give them chance to make huge illegal money. How can you expect a governor in Nigeria that can squander money for 8 years and nothing will happen to want Biafra to be restored. After the squandering, he will go on to win senatorial seat and continue the looting from there. What of a business man that goes to China to request for substandard goods? What of the fake producer of wine in our markets distributing cancer to our people and making huge amounts of money? What of the criminals on our roads masquerading as policemen? What of the immigration officers in our airports collecting 100 dollars from first time travelers? What of the rapists and killers of youths masquerading as Nigeria soldiers? These guys are money bags and they are all out to end this struggle. They have the money and they are doing their best to end it. Biafra is what Nigeria can't be. The duty of these people is to either end IPOB or hand it over to them so that Biafra can become more evil and useless than their Nigeria. These people have bought over criminals that subscribed to IPOB thinking they can make money from it. Some IPOB members thought what IPOB is doing is to end today's oppressors and become tomorrow's oppressors. This was how MASOB derailed. They gave themselves governors of localities and turned themselves gods. They started bullying and extorting money from our people. Their reputation killed and gradually they died a natural death. These dubi-ous men joined IPOB too. They were thinking that when Biafra is restored, they will just be given positions that will allow them to steal. They think when Biafra is restored, they will have the power to put up a decree that will end Christianity. Many of them with many selfish ends. A true freedom fighter must understand that the end game is freedom. He must be ready to be willing to restore Biafra and enthrone laws that will guide every body, and turn the Biafra leader into a people's servant. This is the Biafra of our dreams. Not a Biafra you behave any how, act anyhow and lord it over others. It is not a Biafra you turn yourself into a god simply because you won ordinary governorship election. The sponsors of the infiltrators are the dubi-ous politicians, corrupt businessmen and women. They have recruited criminals among us to try and destroy what we are doing. These criminals will always shout that they are standing on the truth, but can't be proud to say or mention that truth they are standing on. They cannever be proud of that truth. I tell you this day. You must not succumb to them. Anyone telling you to make peace with them is your enemy. No infiltrator or supporter of infiltrators is your comrade. You must see them as worse than the oppressors. You must rise up against them. IPOB must take record of all of them supporting this madness and send them packing. No infiltrator must be allowed into any position in IPOB. Not even the position of a floor member. By so doing, you are not only protecting the struggle, you are also protecting and safeguarding the lives of our people. Every genuine IPOB member should understand that it is you against these criminals. I tell you this always. A hungry man is not just someone that is not rich. Most rich people in Nigeria are actually hungry. You can be rich or poor and still be hungry. This is why Nigeria politicians upon all their riches are still looting. This is why they were able to buy over lots of them abroad, and they contacted some of them in the zoo and rendered them one or two help and they sold their conscience. We must be careful. We must protect this struggle from these criminals. They might hate you today, but they will soon be defeated. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be released. He will chastise those that became indiscipline. He will maintain the sack of all the dubi-ous infiltrators. He will not give room for what happened this time to happen again. And finally, those that stood strong to defend this struggle will be celebrated as heroes. Elochukwu Ohagi, Philosopher, Teacher and Activist, 2022.",,,,,,,,,195,0

An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. We are doing the best we can to make sure we come to you Live and Direct!!! However, we are going to see what we can do to rectify the problem, but if all efforts fail, or should there be any interruption during the broadcast of which I am sure there will be, please use other platform such as our Radio Biafra App. Darkness can not stop us this evening. 3. Tonight we start by laying a background as we normally do. 4. Such an important and critical meeting you have been asking for ages , and now you finally got it and what did you do? you run quickly to Abuja, acting to be in control of IPOB, can you imagine such an utter garbage. 5. All of you who have been advising me to take it easy with Ohaneze, you tell me, what have we done to them now? 6. Somebody has even said that having a meeting with Ohaneze is like Aburi Accord, they will say one thing and do another thing. 7. I don't want people to say that we are stubborn and we don't listen, now we have given them the opportunity and have you seen where it led us? 8. They even said in their press release that IPOB should work hand in hand with Tony Nnadi one man band, onye ara bu file akpaghari. 9. This was the same thing they did when we had the JANJAWEED ebe di njo, and they have done it again. 10. So this has been their plan all along, so that they can show their masters that they are in control. 11. We must continue, we have to continue. 12. There was a Revolution now that happened in Abuja today, and you should have seen the convoy of military men and police and many people were arrested just for doing a protest. 13. The army said that they have no men to fight Bokoharam and protect families in Southern Kaduna, but you have more men, and more men to go and arrest protesters. 14. You've heard of violence protest going on around the world and none has been arrested. 15. The army left the war front, the army left Southern Kaduna to go and arrest those who are fighting for you for a better living. 16. Some of you forgot that communism collapsed in Soviet union because soldiers refused to shoot at the protesters. 17. Some of you, you wake up in the morning , you wear that your stupid army uniform, or civil defense uniform, you go out to arrest people who are fighting for freedom for the looters. 18. I don't know what is wrong with the HAUSA, the same mistakes you made in the past, you are repeating today. 19. Hausa I am asking you, does it mean you people enjoy being slaves? 20. Have you not seen the video of the national guard in America that were called out to stop protesters, and later joined the protesters? 21. Some of you fools cannot reason very well, if you are privileged with a bit of a common sense , you won't be going out there to arrest those fighting for your freedom. 22. Britain knows that Fulani owes Bokoharam and ISWAP, have they killed anyone? It appears that the more armed you are , the more you are feared and respected. 23. You are carrying a gun arresting someone who are fighting for good road , there is something wrong with a black man's head? 24. I keep asking a black man, don't you have shame? That a white man can come and build you a country. 25. You shouting one Nigeria, ask yourself this question, why is it that when FULANI'S are attacking when you call the army they won't respond? 26. They planned what they are doing many years ago, including the idiots that are going about arresting people and yet your villages are under siege, your mothers are being raped. 27. We are not fighting for marginalisation, we are fighting for freedom and we are not waiting for anyone. 28. Come and join IPOB, let's join hands and make Biafra another Japan. 29. Breaking News!!!!! ISIS and Al-Qaeda are planning to invade the South , and they will take it. What happened to Israel will happen to us, we will have to fight our way back in. 30. As some of you sabo are busy doing your work for the ZOO, some of you your mothers will be raped. 31. And I kept asking them, what are you doing in the ZOO army? 32. All if you idiots canvassing for igbo presidency, let me tell you, the history of your people they kill. you're here you run away to another place, they kept killing you and you are running around like a stomach upset. 33. Thunder will fire all of you fighting for new Nigeria gabarge, you will all will die a painful death. 34. You want to contest for Nigeria Nigeria Presidency, they hate you , Fulani hates you , you are like a goat following the owner , one day they will slaughter you and use you for celebration. 35.

They are always dub-ious and have the resources to carry out any project. Be it bad or good. Do you remember Don Wanny of Omoku Rivers State? He was friend of politicians. They used him to commit many dirty things as to win elections. But when they are done, they hunted him down to Enugu and killed him for something they got no evidence that he committed. They didn't stop there. They also went after his brother and killed him in cold blood in front of his children. The government is facing IPOB now. Lots of things are going on. Mr Ekpa works for this politicians. His job is to use his dubious charismatic way to fool some IPOB followers, then recruit some crimiinals who will do the dirty job for him. The government will be far behind giving him the required resources. There are some people on ground that are ready to do anything provided money is involved. There are also some emotional fools that embraced the struggle. These guys are so emotional that they lack reasoning and tact. They are ready to work for Mr Ekpa because they think and believe the zoo needs to be taught a lesson. They mistake teaching the zoo a lesson with terro-rising their own people. They will aid the destruction of the same struggle they so much cherished. The aim of recruiting Mr Ekpa by the government is to help make the people hate the movement. The greatest problem facing Nigeria government is the fact that almost 90% of Ndị Igbo are pro IPOB. This needs to be punctured. And how can this be done. By terro-rizing the people in the name of freedom, IPOB and Biafra. There is a limit to what the people can take. The story of freedom is always beautiful, but the journey is always painful. Remember the Israelites on their way out of Egypt? They all were happy to leave Egypt at first, but on the way they faced difficulties and murmured against God and Moses. They wished to go back to Egypt and suffer than face what they are presently facing in the name of going to the promise land. Nigeria government desperately need the people of Biafra to turn against this very struggle and that is the job of Mr Ekpa. They will continue to terro-rize the people to the extent that the people will rise up against their own freedom. Don't forget that many are not registered IPOB members but they are fully in support of IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Imagine a situation where Mr Ekpa's gangs on ground starts terro-rising them that they start working against the struggle. This will Isolate the registered members to the extent that they will go underground or even denounce their struggle. Remember that many hard cores are already struggling. Some lost their jobs and many are on the run, changing from state to state. Soon we won't be only running from the wicked government agents, but from our dear brothers, no thanks to Mr Ekpa. They will even go after those writing for IPOB that are on ground. The worse thing is that those Mr Ekpa is using will be flushed out by the government like they did to Don Wanny immediately they achieve their purpose. And Mr Ekpa who is a citizen of another country will forever live happily with the money paid to him. Do you understand what I am saying? I don't really know why I am still writing and risking my safety for those that are not listening. The moment we started fighting the leadership of IPOB and command and control was the time we started endangering our lives and the life of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Don't forget that the master said he won't disappoint you, but you will disappoint him. He also turned around to tell someone not to allow Satan enter him. I will end it here. They will try, but they won't see us. And most importantly, they will fail.

You did think it was Mazi Nnamdi Kanu that was responsible for the atrocities happening in Nigeria. You did think it was him that hid the palliatives away from them. At times I ask myself what exactly these people wants. Do they really want a better Nigeria or could it be a better pocket they wanted? Why is it that they helped the political elements to attribute tribe to the #EndSARS protest. What exactly did they set out to gain? What exactly? After Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's latest interview and his intelligent response to issues, some of them instead of acknowledging the fact that the man is intelligent, kept gossiping around. ""What has his intelligence done towards bringing us Biafra"", one of them asked. This guy is a believer in One useless Nigeria. He is doing absolutely nothing for Biafra restoration, yet he will keep asking useless questions. What Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wants is freedom for all. A situation where everyone, including the Hausa and those of them in the middle belt can live freely as humans. He has repeatedly said he is not against your Restructuring. He has even submitted to the zoo government some conditions that can be termed Restructuring before. When the opportunity came to speak out, he did not sit at the fence to gossip like you guys. He joined his voice with that of the Nigeria youths to speak against police brutality and bad governance. But for you guys, it looks like what you people do is to speak for the oppressors. Your hate for MNK has so beclouded you all that all you do is to gossip, and helping BMC to circulate fake video audio in other to discredit the #EndSARS protest and make it look like it is #IPOB thing.

If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me (in Kenya); even the night shall be light about me. 12. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. 13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 15. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 16. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. 17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. 19. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked (saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies), O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 21. Do not I hate them (Nigeria), O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: 24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. Iseeee iseeee iseeee. #song. 1.

We will forever worship and adore Thee because there is none like Thee. From everlasting to everlasting You remaineth the same. We thank Thee for your servant and our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who You created for the purpose of restoration of Biafra and put in him a different Spirit that no man can lure him to disobey your instructions and commandments. We thank You Lord because nothing happens to him and your people Biafrans without your knowledge. Who will say and it comes to pass when you have not given approval? For only your counsel concerning Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans shall stand. Hence the conspiracies of Saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies are broken in pieces and can never stand. Therefore any one who has a hand in the illegally abduction of Nnamdi Kanu is used to fulfill your purpose and will die as Judas Iscariot. They will all be brought into thy judgement seat and will never escape death, for their iniquity is full. Our Father and our God Chukwu Okike Abiama, we know that your ways are different from man's ways and your thoughts are higher than ours, therefore we trust in Thee to deliver our leader and Biafra Nation your own way. Daniel never knew that lions would not eat him up, he resigned to death, but Thou delivered him by the same king who threw him there. Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego didn't know that the fire would not consume them; but Thou sent your son into the fire to prevent the same fire that burned up those who threw them there from hurting them. We can go on and on to recount thy wonderous works and we are sure that You will fulfill your promise to your servant Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans. The Zoo and Britain do not have what it takes to jail or kill your servant because you have the final say. We are waiting patiently Oh Lord for our leader to rejoin us and together we will sing and praise Thee in Biafra Nation as he said. We commit the ESN, DOS, Legal team, Media warriors, various departments of IPOB family, those who are still incarcerated in various prisons and all genuine Biafrans into Your hands, to uphold us till the (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/IpobRaptureMedia/photos/a.110431337164668/457744295766702/?type=3,,MEDIA prayer for Biafra PSALMS 139 & MNK MNK,,,,,,188,-1.05

He insists Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, has chosen the wrong method to resolve the herdsmen/host community feud ACJ: In view of the current security challenges in Nigeria and the sudden emergence of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Sunday Igboho, as a freedom fighter, where do you stand, and what is your view about Mr. Igboho’s agitation? I will throw back the question to you. Does Sunday Igboho have any agenda? What is that agenda? From what perspective is he fighting for the freedom of Yoruba? If it is from the standpoint of the herdsmen, then we should narrow it down to whether he wants all the herdsmen to quit our land or not? What does he really want? I ask these questions because beyond the herdsmen problem, there are other challenges. Are we now saying that there shouldn’t be recourse to the government or traditional rulers again while trying to find a solution? I will never support self-help because in most cases it gets out of hand and will lead people to a greater crisis. Having stated this, let me put it on record that I frown at and reject in totality any act from any set of people that is capable of threatening the security of Nigeria. I will also not be in support of anybody or a group of people that are making attempts to foment trouble in any part of Nigeria. I am of the opinion that there should be a thought process mechanism that would involve the security operatives, the traditional rulers, the government, and other stakeholders in addressing our security problem. Nigeria as a brand or as a nation is so important in the black race to be thrown into war. Like other concerned Yoruba people, there are bad ones among the herdsmen, but it will be wrong to classify all of them as bad. There are bad ones among Igbos and there are good ones. Likewise, there are bad ones among the Yoruba and there are good ones. In view of this, let us work towards investigating and apprehending culprits and punishing them, rather than resorting to blanket threats that could lead to anarchy in the country. So, for people like Sunday Igboho to get my support, the approach must not be warlike or belligerent. I hate to hear statements like; “I want to free the Yoruba people from this government”, “we want to secede”, “Fulanis should go” and other related provoking statements. Igboho should have a clear vision instead of playing to the gallery. He should also know that it will be difficult for him to singlehandedly champion the cause of identifying the kidnappers among the Fulanis or any other tribe without the support of other stakeholders. Nigeria is not a zoo but a federated country with a constitution. I have also urged my people in Yorubaland not to follow anybody blindly. Much as I want Nigeria's security problems to be addressed, I don’t want anybody to gang up against a particular ethnic group because I also have Iwo sons and daughters spread across the country and I don’t want anybody to gang against them. Happily for me, I have my children in the north and they're well to do, they are not even herders or cart pushers; some are doctors, some are lawyers, we have engineers, there are professors. It will interest you that there is no institution of higher learning in the north without a southerner as lecturers and we have many institutions in the South without a single person from the north. Are we now saying that if a Yoruba man commits an offense in the north, all these people should be wiped off? It shouldn’t be. ACJ: Kabiyesi, what is then the way out? I have said it, the way out is for all stakeholders to come to the drawing board and reason together on how best to fish out culprits among the Fulanis. Are all herders criminals? The question is no. Then let's apply wisdom and go back to that popular Yoruba saying; ‘Ika to ba se, l’Oba nge’, which can roughly be translated to mean that law should be applied to whoever that commits the crime. To me, it’s wrong to tag only an ethnic group as perpetrators of kidnapping. There are Yorubas and there are Igbos who are also involved in the nefarious practices. For instance, if you are talking about kidnappers, the last time I checked my books, the richest and the most celebrated kidnapper in Nigeria is an Igbo man called Evans. Now, can we say because of what Evans did and confessed to having done, should we force all the Igbos out of Yoruba or Hausaland? When you forcefully chase out from your domain people who have lived there for, between 50 and 100 years and all that they go away with are backpacks, then you have sinned against humanity. I felt sad when I saw children and women being pursued as if we were in a war situation.

You see there is a school of thought that is of the idea that the current uncertainty hovering around the nation should be the needed GINGER for Nigeria to restructure, to them all they are concerned about is who represents them from their ward to local Government, State Lawmakers, Governors, Federal lawmakers and finally the Presidency. And I strongly agree with them because that seems to be the shortest, easiest and rational means to effect the true change we seek, if you are not satisfied with the leaders then join a political party and fight your way through, others have done it in different climes so it's not impossible, but what rather seems impossible is the break up of Nigeria. You know these guys fuelling all sorts of evil stories and scary scenes of a break up can not even stand the sound of Knockouts, ie BANGER o, how much more can they stand the sounds of live bullets. To me, any Nigerian opening his mouth to complain without thinking of efforts to personally change the narratives is unpatriotic and unworthy of mention. So when I came across this thread on social media where this young man ripped these naysayers apart I was really happy, the thing sweet my belle die. So our Oga posted a picture of himself having a sumptuous meal with the picture of Tinubu in the background and tagged it ""What a wonderful Sunday"". Boom... the monitoring spirits aka Tatafo's came to attack him, ""so you are in support of this man that brought Buhari in"". Another one said, ""there would not be any election in that zoo country and u are here wishing us a happy Sunday"". Obviously, after expending their hate Oga started to lecture them. ""I like the way I am feeling now , no come use your reggae spoil my blues"" Singing in Tekno's voice ""I no dey sick, You wan gimme medicine, I get money o, You wan help me spend my money Allow me to enjoy myself, Allow me to enjoy myself."" There are no gainsayings about Tinubu's qualification for the presidency of Nigeria, to me, there is no Politian apart from PMB that can compare with Asiwaju, talk less of superseding him. If not that you guys are blinded with hate by now you ought to be in the process of selecting your leaders that you think can change the narratives but instead, you come here to spew hate on my wall, You think the presidency is served like a cup of coffee that you won't work hard to achieve? Tinubu brought in Buhari and so what? When Tinubu was fighting to bring an end to the one-party system the PDP and Obasanjo tried to force on Nigerians what role did you play? When Tinubu was at the vanguard of restoring democracy that Nigerians now enjoy in full where una dey? Funny, some people have lost their senses because of Tinubu...Oga visit Yaba Left to meet your mate there. What Nigeria needs at this time is a leader who can lift them out of their present predicament. A leader the people can trust and one who can defend them, a leader who would understand their problems and challenges and put an end to them. They want a leader who can sacrifice their lives for the betterment of the country. As it stands Tinubu rightly fits in as a detribalized leader who is passionately after the growth and prosperity of our nation. So if you do not have a candidate by now to canvass support for, then hide your face, the other oga goes about saying Nigeria would break up and yet he woke up today in Lagos and is going about his normal daily routine yet he comes to my wall to shout Nigeria would break up. Since Nigeria would break up and he's aware I wonder what you are still doing hustling in Lagos. You guys pretend from now till tomorrow, Tinubu is laying the right foundation towards his aspiration while your choice candidate which at this stage you are still too ashamed to reveal maybe in Dubai frolicking and enjoying himself why you masturbate about my support for Tinubu. Yeye dey smell, If you can not give us a better candidate then keep quiet for life, time is ticking away and by now we need to know the aspirants that are ready to take over leadership positions in a few months from now. Oga's response was apt. In concluding this article I stumbled on a write up on WhatsApp so I decided to share with you guys why we must focus on the coming elections and leave these useless disintegration talks that would serve us no purpose.

(By Nathaniel I. Ndiokwere)
 
PREAMBLE: WHO IS THE RIGHTEOUS ONE?
 
Who is a saint? Who is without sin; let him throw the first stone! Most  Religious people, including the Popes and canonized saints, great Educationists, Professors, great Inventors, Politicians and World leaders – living or alive -  have never been known to be free of sin.  Some are even known to have served prison sentences for various ‘crimes’ before they became world figures!  Few Nigerian political and religious leaders, past and present, are known to be ‘saints’.  
 
Just a few, if any at all, who must have made notable contributions towards the welfare of their people still enjoy a comfortable place in history books! Can we award marks on ‘merit’ to the prominent few we still remember their names in the field of politics in Nigeria? Nnamdi Azikiwe – Zik of Africa, Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Saduana of Sokoto, Tafawa Balewa, Shehu Shagari, Goodluck Jonathan, Obasanjo (civilian) and Muhammadu Buhari (civilian)? Surely ALL OF THEM have/had big DENTS on their character, and surely just few Nigerians speak well of them. They have all big dents! I am sure if human beings can shun prejudices, and speak the truth, not one of the former and present Nigerian leaders may score up to 20% mark.
 
On the State level – Eastern states, as an example: Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibiam, Ukpabi Asika? Jim Nwobodo, Orjiuzor Kalu, Theodore Orji, Samuel Onunaka Mbakwe? Ikedi Ohakim, Rochas Anayo Okorocha, Emeka Ihedioha, Hope Uzodimma - All have big terrible Dents.  Perhaps only SAMUEL MBAKWE may score above 40%!  History supplies verifiable facts and figures.
 
MAZI NNAMDI KANU – THE FORMER ALLEGED ‘CROOK’
 
You may like MNK, hate him, agree with him, disagree; it is becoming clearer that History may at last identify the guy as an indomitable Black-African patriot and freedom fighter after Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela, among former ‘rebels’ who played a great role in the struggle for the liberation of their people from slavery and bondage.
 
 Those who hate Kanu, including his fellow Igbos, write all sorts of trash to discredit IPOB movement and their leader. Look at the type of stuff they write and circulate: “Nnamdi Kanu was once a scammer, 419-er, a fake”….!  No problem. The big question: “What do these enemies of progress hope to achieve by this campaign of calumny? ‘Allegations’, True or False; that WAS in the past; ‘HE WAS…’, ‘MNK used to be….’ But today he is “Born-Again”, intelligent, sensible, and full of wisdom, and speaks the truth.  He is alive today working for the freedom of his people. Why join your enemies to block your freedom and that of generations to come?
 
GOOD LEADERS MAKE SACRIFICES
 
Surely MNK has the largest followers among all Igbo leaders today, and these are not ‘idle useless mob’.  However MNK may not be ‘Superhuman’ and without dent; but his case is surely that of a lone voice in the wilderness! What do you expect from his people! The Bible confirms that a prophet is not acknowledged in his own village, among his own people. What will MNK lose more in Nigeria, when the Cabal, aided by Igbo traitors tried to get rid of the young man in a Historical “Python Dance?” They massacred so many youths and as well brought about the untimely death of his parents.  He escaped death because of the presence of some Biafran soldiers in Nigerian military. If I were MNK I will not give up this struggle, come what may. I will face death and join my dead parents where they are! But let posterity take records.
 
MNK AND THE ZOO REPUBLIC
 
Many ‘educated’ Nigerians do not like MNK primarily because of his ‘language’. But how can you blame the young man, when in a “Democratic country”:
(1)        The IDENTITY of the President  has been under contention for over 3 years now? But I do not admire how the ‘investigation’ of this ‘mystery’, ‘allegation’ is going on! It should NOT be Nnamdi Kanu or any private journalist, foreign or local, who should tell the world the ‘Truth’ of the Matter. It is part of Nigerian History today that ABBA KYARI is dead and buried. Period! Documented, publicly and officially confirmed by “competent” government authorities. The historical records are in the archives.
(2)        The ‘allegation’ that Buhari is dead and buried in Saudi Arabia since 2017 sounds FUNNY!  What should be the “very important reason/s” for Buhari family to hide the death of their father? In a matter of life and death event, is it a Political Party or Government in power that makes public the death of a family member? Is the reason for the Cabal to remain in power till the end of the world enough to frame a ‘conspiracy theory’ surrounding the identity of a Head of State, and to choose or CLONE a non- Nigerian from Sudan, and name him (Dead) Buhari? Does the Cabal need such irresponsible, stupid, (truncated)",,,,177,-2.11

You think I write to beg them? No, that's not true. I write to save my head. Yes, if you don't fight to cure ignorance, your enemies will weaponize those ignorant folks against you. An enemy can poison you through an ofeke family member. It was out of ignorance that many claiming the slavish Nigaaaa Delta today, hate you so much and ignore the people stealing their resources, polluting their lands and impoverishing their own people. If you don't take time. If you keep saying leave them alone, they will tomorrow form the Armies of the janjaweed and march against you. That is how ignorance are weaponized. This is why I write. The truth is that, the people that are mostly marginalized in the Zoo are those people in oil producing communities. But those marginalising them have thoroughly studied them. Understood their way of life and are perfectly using it against them. Let me tell you what the Fulani master planners did. They understood that an average Nigaaaa Deltan love to drink, socialize and above all womanize. So the Fulani decided to create kings among them. Rich kings cares less about them... Kings that will help them control the poor masses. Go to Bayelsa or any other oil producing communities and you will see how destroyed and damaged the youths are. Some are completely damaged. They engage in cultism like tomorrow no dey, and proud themselves as thugs for the politicians. You hardly see a shop belonging to them. That shop is either belonging to Hausa or Igbo man. Most of them will be waiting for amnesty money to arrive, as to enjoy and wait for that of the next month. They shout OUR OYEL yet poverty is written all around them. They drink and breath in polluted air that only but kills them slowly. Do they care? No, they enjoy money from their criminal leaders, while greater masses are marginalized. These kings created by the Fulani will come home ones in a while, share money and tell them how their problem is an Igbo man. Fear Igbo man eeeeeh. Fear them. These things has become their anthem. But it wasn't an Igbo man that is polluting their lands. It wasn't an Igbo man that refused to clean up Ogoni. It wasn't an Igbo man that controls NNPC. It wasn't an Igbo man that disgraced Goodluck Jonathan out of office, yet Igbo man is their problem. This is exactly what the Fulani master told their leaders to be doing. This too is the mentality of their militants. Only few are true to their struggle and these few are over powered by those greedy many. That's why they are easily controlled by their politicians. That's why they make noise only when they need money. That's why the faces that led these struggles are today lavishly rich, while their people are languishing in abject poverty. The worse is that some of them even went as low as accepting ordinary Pipeline Guard contracts from Fulani oligarchy and shamelessly brag with it. When Fulani layed Oil pipes from Niger Delta to Kaduna, they pay the so called Niger Delta youths to guard the same pipe, as they take the oil to build roads and railways for their Fulani brothers in Niger Republic, while turning around to tell them how their Igbo brothers are their enemy. Shame. Talk and they will tell you it doesn't concern you. Talk they tell you to mind your own business. This is my business. I won't let them weaponize your ignorance against me. Never! An average Niger Delta man is at Peace with One Nigeria, but once you mention BIAFRA he will go berserk. These people supposed to be more angry at One Nigeria and pained but they are not. Why? Because of accute ignorance resulting from 51 years of Fulani generated misinformation among those claiming Niger Delta. What a shame. Shame hidden in ignorance.

Mazi Nnamdi Kanu didn't find them wanting, so you can't come out from no where to presume things you know nothing about. We must carry out their command to the latter. Don't let Reno or people like him to fool you. When he write something that trickle your fancy, take it, but have it in your mind that Reno is not your friend. APC and PDP are one and the same. No one betrayed Kanu. MNK's movement in and out of Britain is not a secret to British agencies. If any one wants to get Kanu's movement, he don't need a high IPOB member to reveal it to him. Don't let this guy use you ignite fire in his YouTube channel. Shameless people.

An opening prayer said by leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. We welcome you to yet another edition of Radio Biafra broadcast, this day, the 12th of August, the year of our Lord 2020. 3. As we welcome you, please endeavour to welcome others. 4. That is why we preach this gospel, without fear nor favour. We are not going to surrender, we are not going to capitulate, until Biafra is restored. 5. There is no other race in this world , that is not willing to listen to except Radio Biafra. 6. My name is Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the greatest mass movement on this planet they call earth and it is an honour. 7. We must proceed very very speedily without hesitation and preach this gospel. 8. There is a saying from where we come from ""Ogbu'm ga egbu onwe ya"". Those who came to kill us shall kill themselves. 9. Nasir El Rufai is the chief sponsor of Bokoharam, and all the killer group in the ZOO so said a newspaper article. 10. Some of you don't know that Kastina is an Hausa land that was taking over by the Fulani conquest, due to the stupidity of the HAUSA. 11. For those of you who are championing the Fulani agenda and conquest of our land, I want to warn you to see what is happening in Kastina. 12. I want every Saboteurs to understand, both those with feeding bottle and those Presiding over nkwobi, that Kastina is Hausa land which the seeded to the Fulani and today Fulanis are still killing them today. 13. Nature is designed that the strong will eat the weak, and that is why a lion can cheat and eat other animals. 14. For those of you that are looking to this shirad you called the ZOO Presidency, I want you to look at the HAUSA race and see how Fulanis are killing them 15. I want all these people talking Rubbish to understand that all these their effort to sabotage our people will backfire. 16. There is a video I am going to play where our son called traditional leaders are sharing money from the Fulani. What they are doing today, their children will pay for it in the future. 17. This is a lesson i want Orji Uzo Kalu to learn, this is the lesson I want the supreme court governor in Imo state to learn. 18. Our children will be killed in EBONYI, our children will be killed in Abia, and our children will be killed in IMO. 19. This is a very big lesson for all you Saboteurs, you are putting our race into danger. 20. All of you are behaving like Azikiwe , when Mbonu Ojike warned him but he refused. 21. We were killed before and nobody faced trial, even the fool Gowon that chaired the killing is walking around asking you to pray. 22. The mistake that the Hausas made we cannot afford to make., ""maka na onye ndi iro gbara gburu gburu na eche ndu ya nche"" 23. Britain hate us with passion, and that is why they set up the Willys commission to divide us. 24. The same British defiled the laws of geography and came down to the confluence of Omambara and say that Biafra started here. 25. Britain saw all the Pyramids in Enugu and Britain said if we allow this people to be free the light will come into Africa , and Britain swore. 26. I want us to be very sober and reflective tonights, because there are decisions you make today that will come to bite you in the future. 27. The same thing Orji Uzo kalu is uttering now about igbo Presidency, Azikiwe did the same Rubbish and look at where we are today. 28. Now tell me , in a country that claim to be a democracy is actively involved in Terrorism which Britain is part of it. 29. Bokoharam and bandits are the same ones engaged in killing civilians and then other one is to engage the military, to secure the ZOO for their children and children children. 30. Why did Ortom said , that ""we have failed nigeria "" 31. Do you know why Facebook removed my post is because I told Britain to look at the nigga they created. 32. Their plan is to depopulate our land, their plan is to kill us all and nobody will come to our aid. 33. Somebody is telling you not to defend yourself, are you not an idiot? 34. Do you know the reason why they insisted that Hope Uzodima becomes the Governor? You don't know but I will tell you tonight. 35. Because of the next Ohaneze leader, that's why they put Uzodima there. 36. Now listen to the problem of our people, you know this Ohaneze people , you try to rehabilitate them yet they refused to be rehabilitate. 37. I asked them a simple question, if you see any Efulefu, ask him, have you seen any Yoruba man come out to condem OPC? 38. But you people that kept on coming out sabotaging your people, have you gotten anything? The answer is No. 39. He will remain the supreme court Governor and that will remain his name forever. 40. People need to understand that islam must expand is a natural phynominal. 41. I have said it before , that Biafra must come or we all die.

Do you know how many times northern senators called for his arrest for supporting ipob and yet the man stood his ground both in the plenaries and on national tv. Infact in one of his interview on channels tv he categorically made it clear that if they call him again to guarantee mazi nnamdi KANU he will gladly do it again and again. Don't also forget that he has visited mazi nnamdi KANU in the dss dungeon while most of you castigating him have never appeared in solidarity with MNK in court one day. Politicians are not to be trusted yes but abaribe have not shown me any sign for me to hate on him. Abaribe knows that all ipob members will not even vote him because they don't even have pvc to do that so why are we disturbing ourselves I just verbally said that I will give him my support but have you asked yourself how I am going to achieve that because I don't even have a pvc,I have never voted in my entire life and I will not be in nigeria when elections will be conducted and my platform is not for political party but pure freedom fighting. Abaribe have not given me any reason to hate him even mazi nnamdi KANU talks good about him all the time..

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25.

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I don't believe in the ZOO called Nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he said. I LOVE JESUS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man? 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine? 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37.

There have been shooting of youths at Lekki Tollgate, Aba, Enugu, Ondo, Onitsha etc, yet these guys left all these to write hateful posts against Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Really? You did think it was Mazi Nnamdi Kanu that was responsible for the atrocities happening in Nigeria. You did think it was him that hid the palliatives away from them. At times I ask myself what exactly these people wants. Do they really want a better Nigeria or could it be a better pocket they wanted? Why is it that they helped the political elements to attribute tribe to the #EndSARS protest. What exactly did they set out to gain? What exactly? After Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's latest interview and his intelligent response to issues, some of them instead of acknowledging the fact that the man is intelligent, kept gossiping around. ""What has his intelligence done towards bringing us Biafra"", one of them asked. This guy is a believer in One useless Nigeria. He is doing absolutely nothing for Biafra restoration, yet he will keep asking useless questions. What Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wants is freedom for all. A situation where everyone, including the Hausa and those of them in the middle belt can live freely as humans. He has repeatedly said he is not against your Restructuring. He has even submitted to the zoo government some conditions that can be termed Restructuring before. When the opportunity came to speak out, he did not sit at the fence to gossip like you guys. He joined his voice with that of the Nigeria youths to speak against police brutality and bad governance. But for you guys, it looks like what you people do is to speak for the oppressors. Your hate for MNK has so beclouded you all that all you do is to gossip, and helping BMC to circulate fake video audio in other to discredit the #EndSARS protest and make it look like it is #IPOB thing. I say shame on you guys. Instead of gossiping, why not lend your voice with the courageous Nigeria youths who have in 100s paid the ultimate prize for a better future. Stop licking the behinds of these dirty Nigeria politicians and you must have done something reasonable for your future.",https://www.facebook.com/FamilyWritersPress/photos/a.1754746864772117/2722495257997268/?type=3,,,,,,,,157,4.62

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business.

The APC believes that the country has the potentials and talents that can develop alternative and competitive applications to existing platforms in the world. Twitter’s suspension will undoubtedly serve as a positive trigger to unleash the creative potentials of Nigerians in the global digital space.” Akpanudoedehe claimed it was a challenge to the vibrant youths with such talents, adding that they would get support in the exercise from relevant federal government agencies as well as the numerous Information and Communication Technology (ICT) training and research establishments in the country. He recalled that the APC had earlier released a statement asking Twitter and other operators of social media pages to use their platforms to check divisive and inciting rhetoric, particularly in Nigeria. The ruling party said it tasked them on the important responsibilities to curb fake news, disinformation and hate speech, among others, adding that evidently, “Twitter failed to do this and even allowed their platform to be used by arsonists, insurrectionists and separatists in the country.” Twitter Promises Nigerians Access to New Platform, Belatedly Deletes Kanu’s Bile Tweets American microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, has promised to restore access to its new platform to all Nigerians. A tweet by Twitter’s Public Policy yesterday said open internet was an essential human right and would help Nigerians, who relied on its platform to connect with the world. Twitter made the vow in reaction to the indefinite suspension slammed on it by the Nigerian Government. Meanwhile, less than 24 hours after the federal government banned Twitter, the global microblogging platform has deleted ‘inciting’ tweets from the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist group agitating for the Republic of Biafra. In the controversial tweet, the IPOB leader vowed to unleash terror on Nigerian soldiers deployed to the South-east. He also used derogatory words to describe some government officials. “It’s not for the living to respond to the dead but given the lack of reasoning prevalent in the #Zoo Nigeria, I wish to assure @GarShehu (Garba Shehu), the Jihadi midget @elrufai (Nasir El-Rufai) & that Fulani lapdog Femi Adesina that any army they send to #Biafraland will die there. None will return alive,” Kanu tweeted via his handle Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,146,3.4

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR RADIO AND BAIFAR TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Baifran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35. Things are now happening in ZOO and I thank Chukwu Okike Abiama for that. 36. People that kept your name away from the people that suffered Genocide, are they going to love you ? 37. Ask yourself why did Britian swore that Biafra will not arise, they said over their dead bodies and that is why Britain will be divided. 38. I commend the Oduduwa agitators for coming out today to campaign in London. 39. In this era of Big brother, the indomie people forget so easily. 40.

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri. We are the descendants of Gad. Go (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/OfficialSunibestOkafor/photos/a.700000480167691/1591431127691284/?type=3,,,,,,,,139,1.1

SHABBATH SHALOM GREAT BIAFRANS!

KING JAMES VERSION (KJV).
Psalms 139:1-24(BIAFRA WAY)  
1. O LORD, thou hast searched me, Nnamdi Kanu, and known me.
2. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
3. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
5. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
8. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea (in Great Britain);
10. Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me (in Kenya); even the night shall be light about me.
12. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
15. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
16. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
19. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked (saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies), O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
21. Do not I hate them (Nigeria), O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Let us pray.
We thank Thee Oh God our Father for your immeasurable love towards us. We will forever worship and adore Thee because there is none like Thee. From everlasting to everlasting You remaineth the same.
We thank Thee for your servant and our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who You created for the purpose of restoration of Biafra and put in him a different Spirit that no man can lure him to disobey your instructions and commandments.
We thank You Lord because nothing happens to him and your people Biafrans without your knowledge.
Who will say and it comes to pass when you have not given approval? For only your counsel concerning Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans shall stand.
Hence the conspiracies of Saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies are broken in pieces and can never stand. 
Therefore any one who has a hand in the illegally abduction of Nnamdi Kanu is used to fulfill your purpose and will die as Judas Iscariot. They will all be brought into thy judgement seat and will never escape death, for their iniquity is full.
Our Father and our God Chukwu Okike Abiama, we know that your ways are different from man's ways and your thoughts are higher than ours, therefore we trust in Thee to deliver our leader and Biafra Nation your own way.
Daniel never knew that lions would not eat him up, he resigned to death, but Thou delivered him by the same king who threw him there.
Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego didn't know that the fire would not consume them; but Thou sent your son into the fire to prevent the same fire that burned up those who threw them there from hurting them.
We can go on and on to recount thy wonderous works and we are sure that You will fulfill your promise to your servant Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans.
The Zoo and Britain do not have what it takes to jail or kill your servant because you have the final say.
We are waiting patiently Oh Lord for our leader to rejoin us and together we will sing and praise Thee in Biafra Nation as he said.
We commit the ESN, DOS, Legal team, Media warriors, various departments of IPOB family, those who are still incarcerated in various prisons and all genuine Biafrans into Your hands, to uphold us (truncated)",,,,135,-2.6

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business.

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18.

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened. 3. Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 5. Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man, ignorance, stupidity, jealousy, envy and greed. 6. It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 7. Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 8. I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes . 19. There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 20. Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 21. Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". you see, this is how they roll. 22. That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away, that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 23. Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off, and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 24. Have you ever wondered, your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 25. Thanks to Radio Biafra, people are now listening and have started to reason. 26. Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 27. As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 28. When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 29. The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you. 30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday, and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course. 31.

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I dont belive in the ZOO called nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he has I LOVE JESUS AND IM PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. I.G.B.O is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable , the igbo is a very very stubborn race , to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us Previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger , and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested , the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as thr so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previ to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers , but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother , how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm , please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do ? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed , that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school , did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even come onto the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries , refine it there and bring it back to you , tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37.

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri. We are the descendants of Gad. Go to your history book and make your research.

Why did you not ask your supreme liar Nnamdi Kanu why he set up another radio but today the same radio biafra taken over by the zoo is still with him? That singular lie and wickedness of your supreme liar Nnamdi Kanu, borne out of arrogance is the genesis of what have put all of you in tatters and in disarray today, no matter how you pretend. Ask him to give explanation of why he knew that he was lying to all of you and the whole world that day----- praying to and calling on God that and at the same simultaneously lying with the same mouth that radio biafra was sold, taken over by the zoo etc. He disconnected himself from radio biafra feed,removed satellite link from radio biafra and was broadcasting on IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO alone because he wanted to you reason why all of you switch to IPOB COMMUNITYRADIO so that nobody will hear Uche Okafor-Mefor again on radio. Unfortunately, it boomeranged when people could not hear his live broadcast on the usual radio biafra platform, when he realised that he couldn't be heard ,he now started coming back to me after the Demon in Australia called Chukwudi Ofoma had deceived him.

(4) What's the agreement that MAZI NNAMDI KANU have with you, that he later failed to fulfill?

If they buy you a gold, you might not care for it, simply because you don't know the worth. Same thing is applicable to freedom. You must fight for freedom, so you can treasure it. Ndị Igbo have given it all for freedom. Another group of youths that have given it all are Akwaibom youths. These youths were there in 2017 when Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's house was attacked by Nigeria military. They came down to Nkpor too and some paid the ultimate prize. I also watched some pictures of Akwaibom indigenes that were locked up in Nigeria prison because of Biafra. Because they were IPOB members, they were starved by prison wardens to the extent that they looked exactly like Kwashiorkor patients. It is the prize for Freedom that drives patriotism. Without it you will get freedom and mess it up. The Biafra we seek will never be like Nigeria. It won't be one federal feeding bottle system of government. Biafra will comprise of nations. A people united in purpose. We shall know our differences and treasure it. There will be no shouts of one Biafra, for Biafra is a coming together of many nations. In this Biafra you will make your laws and in your own language. You will take charge of your resources and control commerce. Your local language can be elevated to become your means of communication. And you can chose to exit Biafra at anytime through a referendum. I am not making this up. I have heard the IPOB leader say them. This means that no one will build your own part of Biafra for you except you. I used the last sit at home to determine the level of acceptance for our freedom. And I found out that Ijaw as a people are still lagging behind in terms of setting themselves free from this zoo. Some of their youths are still engrossed with politics and listening to politicians that have looted them dry. These politicians lie to them that Igbo is their problem, while they keep looting them. There is every need to teach every Ijaw child to understand that there is no hope for him or her in Nigeria. Judging from the last sit at home, I can tell you that the average Ijaw man is still far from embracing freedom. And this is pathetic. Those of them fooling themselves about Niger Delta Republic of entire South South should wake up already. I even wonder why no one is actually fighting for Niger Delta Republic, no leader, no protest, but once any of them hears Biafra, they will remember Niger Delta Republic. You must understand that Nigeria in other to downsize the Igbo people carved them into what they called South South. I watched these Igbo people from Rivers, Delta to Benue observe last Monday Sit At Home. This will tell you that all Igbo people are united in Biafra. I am not saying you can't have your Niger Delta Republic, you can have it, but you have to stop dreaming of having Ndị Igbo in it. You can't love part of Ndị Igbo and hate some. You can't love Ngozi from Egbema in Rivers State and hate Ngozi from Egbema in Imo State. It is never down. You can't fight this alone. Don't say when Igbo people leave, then you will start your own agitation. They won't let you. You must start now to stand for something. You must stop listening to these wicked and selfish leaders. Lies is what they tell you. Igbo youths had to depart from the their leaders before they saw light. You must do the same. If you need your own Nation, it is more feasible in Biafra. Don't wait to be begged. Don't wait to be consulted, for no one consulted anyone of us. And no one will Bribe you to accept freedom. Thank God MNK said it already that every nation in Biafra will vote differently during referendum. Meaning that those that say they are not Biafrans will have the opportunity to vote themselves out. Come Monday 16th, we will again observe another referendum and you will agree with me that Igbo people both in South East and South South have decided that it is Biafra or Biafra.

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",https://www.facebook.com/101533515085621/photos/a.154655573106748/286038136635157/?type=3,,,,,,,,109,2.95

You think I write to beg them? No, that's not true. I write to save my head. Yes, if you don't fight to cure ignorance, your enemies will weaponize those ignorant folks against you. An enemy can poison you through an ofeke family member. It was out of ignorance that many claiming the slavish Nigaaaa Delta today, hate you so much and ignore the people stealing their resources, polluting their lands and impoverishing their own people. If you don't take time. If you keep saying leave them alone, they will tomorrow form the Armies of the janjaweed and march against you. That is how ignorance are weaponized. This is why I write. The truth is that, the people that are mostly marginalized in the Zoo are those people in oil producing communities. But those marginalising them have thoroughly studied them. Understood their way of life and are perfectly using it against them. Let me tell you what the Fulani master planners did. They understood that an average Nigaaaa Deltan love to drink, socialize and above all womanize. So the Fulani decided to create kings among them. Rich kings cares less about them... Kings that will help them control the poor masses. Go to Bayelsa or any other oil producing communities and you will see how destroyed and damaged the youths are. Some are completely damaged. They engage in cultism like tomorrow no dey, and proud themselves as thugs for the politicians. You hardly see a shop belonging to them. That shop is either belonging to Hausa or Igbo man. Most of them will be waiting for amnesty money to arrive, as to enjoy and wait for that of the next month. They shout OUR OYEL yet poverty is written all around them. They drink and breath in polluted air that only but kills them slowly. Do they care? No, they enjoy money from their criminal leaders, while greater masses are marginalized. These kings created by the Fulani will come home ones in a while, share money and tell them how their problem is an Igbo man. Fear Igbo man eeeeeh. Fear them. These things has become their anthem. But it wasn't an Igbo man that is polluting their lands. It wasn't an Igbo man that refused to clean up Ogoni. It wasn't an Igbo man that controls NNPC. It wasn't an Igbo man that disgraced Goodluck Jonathan out of office, yet Igbo man is their problem. This is exactly what the Fulani master told their leaders to be doing. This too is the mentality of their militants. Only few are true to their struggle and these few are over powered by those greedy many. That's why they are easily controlled by their politicians. That's why they make noise only when they need money. That's why the faces that led these struggles are today lavishly rich, while their people are languishing in abject poverty. The worse is that some of them even went as low as accepting ordinary Pipeline Guard contracts from Fulani oligarchy and shamelessly brag with it. When Fulani layed Oil pipes from Niger Delta to Kaduna, they pay the so called Niger Delta youths to guard the same pipe, as they take the oil to build roads and railways for their Fulani brothers in Niger Republic, while turning around to tell them how their Igbo brothers are their enemy. Shame. Talk and they will tell you it doesn't concern you. Talk they tell you to mind your own business. This is my business. I won't let them weaponize your ignorance against me. Never! An average Niger Delta man is at Peace with One Nigeria, but once you mention BIAFRA he will go berserk. These people supposed to be more angry at One Nigeria and pained but they are not. Why? Because of accute ignorance resulting from 51 years of Fulani generated misinformation among them claiming Niger Delta. What a shame. Shame hidden in ignorance.

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU!

I am a Biafran and I am proud of my people. When we love you, we don't hide it at all, rather we come out in the open to tell how much we love. The same way when we hate you may be as a reciprocal to your hatred on us, we don't hide it we come out in the open to tell you how bad you are and how we hate you. I think this uncommon virtue is what separates us from other tribes in Nigeria. From the onset, among the perceived founding fathers of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe was the only person who believe actually in Nigeria project. Evidently Ahmadu Bellow believed in Northernization, Obafemi Awolowo was an unapologetic believer in Yoruba nation. The North was the first to clamour for cessation in Hausa language shouting Araba! Araba! Araba! That was after they killed 300 military officers of Igbo extraction in a revenge or counter coup in 1966. Now after the war in 1970 the 3R; reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction were hypocritically pronounced by the mass murderer; General Yakubu Gowon. The Biafrans later put the war behind them and went ahead to develop other regions using trade and commerce as the only viable means of livelihood, not minding the hatred and xenophobic attacks on our business in the North and western part of the country. Biafrans voted for M.K.O. Abiola a Yoruba man. Olusegun Obasanjo a Yoruba man, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua a Fulani man. We have shown our true patriotism to Nigeria project. But GEJ our brother from Bayelsa state could not be tolerated by any tribe to go for a second tenure as other Presidents, including the Northern Nigeria where he wanted to eradicate Almajiri institution through his education policies. Our generosity to the Yorubas by voting their own, was not even enough for the Yorubas to allow GEJ to complete his second tenure. They used all the arsenal within their disposal including the media, to demonize him internationally, his fight against Boko Haram was portrayed as human right abuse and genocide, the rest is history. All the sea ports in our land remain closed by Government fiat, so that Lagos will remain the only viable megacity economically in Nigeria. No international airport in Biafra land, no rail project in Biafra land not to talk of the deplorable state of the federal roads in our land. The only federal government project in our land are the uncountable police and military check points, the Fulani Terrorist in our farm land carrying AK47, destroying our crops raping our wives, sisters, mothers and daughters, beheading our young men and old men. The reason for writing this post is to enlighten those Biafra Nigerianists, to know that other ethnic groups in Nigeria do not believe in Nigeria project and so should let go of a united Nigeria the zoo, as such is mere illusion. Muhammadu Buhari a Fulani man, won election in 2015, he made sure he replaced every Westerner and Easterner in any sensitive position with a Fulani man, including the Military, Police, Customs Immigration and NNPC. He made himself the Petroleum minister. Before Election, Abba Kyari replaced Walter Onnoghen with Tanko Mohammed a Sharia judge. This people never believed in Nigeria project, rather they adhere strictly to the Northernization policy as preached by Late Sardauna of Sokoto; Ahmadu Bello, where he vowed to put the Northerners in every sensitive position in Nigeria, in case there is no Northerner qualified for the job, an expatriate should be employed instead of an Igbo man. Yorubas with their media do not believe in Nigeria project, they have vowed not report the killing of Biafrans by Fulani terror herdsmen, they have intentionally refused to report the looting going on in Nigeria by the ruling cabal in Nigeria, so that the Northerners may reward them with the office of the President come 2023. Tinubu made sure Easterners were chased out of the polling units in Lagos during the last general election, in a country where Easterners like the gullible and nauseating Joe Igbo, Nnia Nwodo and all the indolent and indocile south-east and south-south politicians believe in one Nigeria. Biafrans are the only ones that built structures in others regions, because they erroneously believe in Nigeria project. They are the ones who can attend a church owned by a Yoruba or Hausa man without feeling insecure. Thanks to Elohim for using Mazi Nnamdi to open the eyes of the blind Biafrans.

An opening prayer said by leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. We welcome you to yet another edition of Radio Biafra broadcast, this day, the 12th of August, the year of our Lord 2020. 3. As we welcome you, please endeavour to welcome others. 4. That is why we preach this gospel, without fear nor favour. We are not going to surrender, we are not going to capitulate, until Biafra is restored. 5. There is no other race in this world , that is not willing to listen to except Radio Biafra. 6. My name is Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the greatest mass movement on this planet they call earth and it is an honour. 7. We must proceed very very speedily without hesitation and preach this gospel. 8. There is a saying from where we come from ""Ogbu'm ga egbu onwe ya"". Those who came to kill us shall kill themselves. 9. Nasir El Rufai is the chief sponsor of Bokoharam, and all the killer group in the ZOO so said a newspaper article. 10. Some of you don't know that Kastina is an Hausa land that was taking over by the Fulani conquest, due to the stupidity of the HAUSA. 11. For those of you who are championing the Fulani agenda and conquest of our land, I want to warn you to see what is happening in Kastina. 12. I want every Saboteurs to understand, both those with feeding bottle and those Presiding over nkwobi, that Kastina is Hausa land which the seeded to the Fulani and today Fulanis are still killing them today. 13. Nature is designed that the strong will eat the weak, and that is why a lion can cheat and eat other animals. 14. For those of you that are looking to this shirad you called the ZOO Presidency, I want you to look at the HAUSA race and see how Fulanis are killing them 15. I want all these people talking Rubbish to understand that all these their effort to sabotage our people will backfire. 16. There is a video I am going to play where our son called traditional leaders are sharing money from the Fulani. What they are doing today, their children will pay for it in the future. 17. This is a lesson i want Orji Uzo Kalu to learn, this is the lesson I want the supreme court governor in Imo state to learn. 18. Our children will be killed in EBONYI, our children will be killed in Abia, and our children will be killed in IMO. 19. This is a very big lesson for all you Saboteurs, you are putting our race into danger. 20. All of you are behaving like Azikiwe , when Mbonu Ojike warned him but he refused. 21. We were killed before and nobody faced trial, even the fool Gowon that chaired the killing is walking around asking you to pray. 22. The mistake that the Hausas made we cannot afford to make., ""maka na onye ndi iro gbara gburu gburu na eche ndu ya nche"" 23. Britain hate us with passion, and that is why they set up the Willys commission to divide us. 24. The same British defiled the laws of geography and came down to the confluence of Omambara and say that Biafra started here. 25. Britain saw all the Pyramids in Enugu and Britain said if we allow this people to be free the light will come into Africa , and Britain swore. 26. I want us to be very sober and reflective tonights, because there are decisions you make today that will come to bite you in the future. 27. The same thing Orji Uzo kalu is uttering now about igbo Presidency, Azikiwe did the same Rubbish and look at where we are today. 28. Now tell me , in a country that claim to be a democracy is actively involved in Terrorism which Britain is part of it. 29. Bokoharam and bandits are the same ones engaged in killing civilians and then other one is to engage the military, to secure the ZOO for their children and children children. 30. Why did Ortom said , that ""we have failed nigeria "" 31. Do you know why Facebook removed my post is because I told Britain to look at the nigga they created. 32. Their plan is to depopulate our land, their plan is to kill us all and nobody will come to our aid. 33. Somebody is telling you not to defend yourself, are you not an idiot? 34. Do you know the reason why they insisted that Hope Uzodima becomes the Governor? You don't know but I will tell you tonight. 35. Because of the next Ohaneze leader, that's why they put Uzodima there. 36. Now listen to the problem of our people, you know this Ohaneze people , you try to rehabilitate them yet they refused to be rehabilitate. 37. I asked them a simple question, if you see any Efulefu, ask him, have you seen any Yoruba man come out to condem OPC? 38. But you people that kept on coming out sabotaging your people, have you gotten anything? The answer is No. 39. He will remain the supreme court Governor and that will remain his name forever. 40. People need to understand that islam must expand is a natural phynominal. 41. I have said it before , that Biafra must come or we all die.

Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem. Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.” He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then. He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote. But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari! Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines. This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t known of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari. Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",https://www.facebook.com/naijamustworkagain/photos/a.333102354118308/992120431549827/?type=3,,,,,,,,92,-2.43

I was about to go home before he stopped me. His face was so mean and from the look of things he wanted to tell me something important. ""Trust our Kogi people, we no dey carry last ....Prince Audu has resurrected"" he muttered. Lol .....I laughed at his ignorance. How can this young man still be talking of resurrection, 5days after Prince Audu has been buried, and the event widely publicized? This reminded me of the man that told me that Obama has said that Biafra will get her independence in December. How these people got their news baffles me. I didn't waste time telling him that Prince Audu is dead and gone. I told him to always apply reason in everything, and stop believing those beer parlor newscasters. 'But waitoooo ......one thing the vex me', he said again. He was extra mean this time, 'why should some Biafrans be calling Nigeria a ZOO? ' This is disrespectful to our country. Probably he is from Igala. Yes, he has told me, he is from igala. His name is Ositadimma, a name given to him by his grandmum who hails from Anambra. I felt his pain, he sounded so patriotic. He told me how people should even lie to defend their own country. Yes... who said I don't know that a citizen of a country has to be patriotic to his nation, but lies as a part of it are what am not sure of. I remembered a film I watched, it was an American film, this particular American soldier refused to leave their flag across the enemy line after the person carrying it was hit. It's a film but it captured what patriotism is all about. But in the case of Nigeria, should I blame people that call her a zoo or a lugardian cage? You should judge yourself. In the zoo, things are orderly and kept, and animals don't eat other animals. Then one wonders if Nigeria merited the name zoo, or should we look for something better? Looking at things happening in Nigeria, I think it's not fair to call Nigeria a zoo. We should call a spade a spade. Nigeria is not a zoo, but an evil forest. It's only in an evil forest that a lecturer will fail a student, ask her to go and book a room in a big hotel, rapes the helpless student, and go on to give the unfortunate student pass. It's only in an evil forest that animals feed on other lesser animals. It's only in an evil forest that one man will steal a nation dry and nothing will happen. It's only in an evil forest that 100,000 youths will pay 2500 naira for a military slot of 4000. It's only in an evil forest that policemen can shoot drivers because of 20 naira. It's only in an evil forest that see illiterates become leaders and literates servants. It's only in an evil forest that a contractor will walk away from the contract without being questioned. It's only in an evil forest that lies are called patriotism It's only in the evil forest that about 105 soldiers are buried secretly. It's only in an evil forest that animals hate each other and still force oneness on themselves. I can go on and on ............. Truth is bitter but got to be said. Let the name-calling start ...... Let's go.",,,,,,,,,91,-4.26

Imagine Otelectuals such as; Okenyi Kenechi, Charles Ogbu, Charles Awuzie, Ugo Egbujo, Nnaemeka Obiaraeri, etc. Throwing thumps up for Simon Ekpa and encouraging him to never give up.. Screw it! I would have been amongst the top 10 critiques of Simon Ekpa. And who knows! I would have tendered my unreserved apologies to that bluenose liquidator in Kuwait, Chinasa Nworu because Mazi Nnamdi Kanu told us that any actions or activities which upsets the One-Nigeria progenitors, we should stick to it. And anything they applaud, we should run away from it. The aforementioned names of political otimkpus, had cloud 9 orgasm, character-assassinating Mazi Nnamdi Kanu back when he proclaimed that until a date for a non-violent plebiscite is set by the Nigerian authorities, there was never going to be any form of electioneering activities and voting in Biafraland. Immediately MNK made that proclamation especially Anambra Election boycott, all hell got loosed on all the otellectuals, they came publishing their panoply of lies and deceit, back to back.. So many conspiracy theories got thrown up in the air. Some said that MNK was undoubtedly a ardent hater of Ndigbo. He was called a war-monger. Charles Ogbu in particular called MNK a ruthless anarchist who hide behind the agitation to pursue his personal vendetta. Some said MNK was working with APC. It got worse during #EndSARS protest.. These pessimists accused MNK of masterminding the killings of security officers, burning and destruction of government facilities especially police stations and banks. These political hatchet men, went as extreme as calling on Buhari's government to quickly arrest and extradite MNK back to Nigeria to answer for his heinous crimes. These otelectuals gave us the IPOB media warriors countless sleepless nights. We were literally online 24/7 countering their lies and propaganda until we defeated and chased them back to their huts. Back last year when the heart-rending news of Kanu's abduction, torture and extraordinary rendition hit the media space, majority of them were happy and never for once, called for the unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. They all maintained criminal silence over the illegal torture and detention of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Fortunately for us and unfortunately for them when the believed that the prosecution of MNK would end the agitation for Biafra restoration as proclaimed by Garba Shehu, Mazi Simon Ekpa came in for a rescue and these sadists cum never-do-wells have fixed their useless calumny campaign radar on Simon Ekpa. Same e-rats who went unhinged complaining bitterly when the Appellate Court struck out the treasonable felony charges brought against Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and gave a judgment that he should be freed, these otelectuals now Un-Yusuful dis-OBIdient campaigners came ranting on social media that MNK is being released by APC to work against their demigod Mr Peter Obi, have suddenly turned around to say that Ekpa is hell bent on making sure Muhammadu Buhari's government sees reasons to continue holding MNK.. Laughable isn't it! That these online roaches are unleashing same hate campaign on Simon Ekpa which he threw at MNK, that alone should convince you that indeed, Simon is on the right track when it comes to the agitation for Biafra restoration.. But, it beats my imagination seeing that same agitators whom I once regarded as hardcores, now on the same page with the otellectuals in casting aspersions on Simon Ekpa. Same thing they fought day and night defending MNK from these One-Nigeria advocates, today, they are collaborating with them in slandering Simon Ekpa. And you want me to believe that Simon Ekpa isn't on the right track? You want me to join you in fighting to bring down a man I am supposed to give both my physical, spiritual, mental, emotional support to? Miss me with that bvllshit cos that ain't never gonna happen. Simon Ekpa has my unrestricted support a trillion times over and as he has repeatedly said that until MNK is unconditionally freed and Biafra restored next year, all forms of electioneering activities and voting in Biafraland will be fought against, I support him a zillion times over. And if you insist that election must hold, then pack your slave luggages and move to the northern part of your darling zoo country.

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri.

Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem. Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.” He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then. He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote. But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari! Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines. This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t known of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari. Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",https://www.facebook.com/iReportaz/photos/a.1270522336389381/4026968074078113/?type=3,,,,,,,,87,1.61

When people started trending Simon Ekpa as the New Director of Radio Biafra, I was surprised at their ignorance. I asked myself how Broadcasting from Radio Biafra translate to being the Director of Radio Biafra. Even some PDP charlatans have started trending Ekpa as the New Leader of Radio Biafra. And they have started using propaganda against the young man. Let me also state it here that like many of us, Simon Ekpa was previously for a better Nigeria. Me too, there was a time I was writing and asking that Nigeria should restructure as the only way to sustain the country. I continued this, until I found out that Nigeria as a country can never get better. At least not with the Islamization and Fulanization agenda of the Fulani. The North sees Restructuring as handing over to the South. So it won't happen. I noticed this and hands up from the ignorance and stupidity called quest for Restructuring. Let me tell you here that those still shouting Restructuring are ignorant. So, you see, we all didn't wake up one day and started agitating for Biafra. We all have our stories and how Nigeria happened to us. Simon Ekpa was a political commentator before he joined IPOB. Simon was sympathetic to PDP and have written many works for PDP. Mr Ekpa lost interest in Nigeria and everything about Nigeria after the rigging in 2019. Simon couldn't believe it. He noticed, like I did many years ago that Nigeria is unsalvageable. He then launched what he called, changing the narrative of yesterday. This campaign saw Simo Ekpa starting to speak about Biafra. For him, Nigeria is gone and only Biafra can save us. When Mr Simon Ekpa started this new campaign, he was so real, but some of us have their doubts. So I personally commented on his wall, asking him never to change. I must say that till today, Ekpa have shown more dedication to Biafra restoration than any other thing he has ever embarked on. I am saying all these for you to understand exactly whom Simon Ekpa was before he joined the struggle. I am saying it because with his current position in IPOB, lots of propaganda will be coming from the desk of PDP members. I have warned our people to see PDP as same with APC. The two groups doesn't want Nigeria to divide, and can do anything to keep this corrupt center going. They two are your enemies. When you see them bring up videos or write ups Mr Ekpa made as a supporter of PDP some few years ago, please do disregard it. They are just trying to put doubt in you. Those that don't know should know it now that even our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was once in APGA. He once believed that with APGA, we can take over entire political structure in Biafra land and use it to move for Biafra independence, but he also found out that it can't work in a zoo. That's why he looked at people saying we should join politics, vote and elect those with Biafra mindset as jokers. He has been there and knows it can't work. I am happy to read the bellow clarification from Mr Simon Ekpa concerning the situation of things. Those questioning every directives of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are not true Comrades. They will keep writing trash, after which they will come to apologise. And I wonder why they are not tired of apology. Read this words from Mr Ekpa and be guided. Mr Ekpa will be broadcasting through Radio Biafra and not the New Director of Radio Biafra or Leader of IPOB. Hear Mazi Simon Ekpa... -------------------------------- ""Let me rhetorically state that there is no vacuum in the leadership of IPOB, there is no vacuum in the position of director of Radio Biafra. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu remain the Director of Radio Biafra and his directive is final as we maintain the command and control. Our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will continue to lead the struggle from where ever he is, be it in the prison, DSS custody, police detention or from AsoRock detention. The directive of our leader on the 8th of July 2021 is that I, Simon Ekpa should start broadcasting from Radio Biafra with immediate effect, to maintain the legacy and sustain the momentum of the movement, a task I accepted without hesitation because the situation requires extra ordinary media war to sustain, expose the impunity of the Nigeria State, to expose the genocide and end the enslavement of indigenous people in Nigeria in a different level. Whoever have issues with this should check him or herself. The directive of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is not just a wish, it is an order. I am Simon Ekpa, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s disciple on Biafra restoration. On this day, 10.7.2021."" ---------------------------------- Dearest Simon Ekpa, know it that we support you. Also know it that every body must not like you.

If they buy you a gold, you might not care for it, simply because you don't know the worth. Same thing is applicable to freedom. You must fight for freedom, so you can treasure it. Ndị Igbo have given it all for freedom. Another group of youths that have given it all are Akwaibom youths. These youths were there in 2017 when Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's house was attacked by Nigeria military. They came down to Nkpor too and some paid the ultimate prize. I also watched some pictures of Akwaibom indigenes that were locked up in Nigeria prison because of Biafra. Because they were IPOB members, they were starved by prison wardens to the extent that they looked exactly like Kwashiorkor patients. It is the prize for Freedom that drives patriotism. Without it you will get freedom and mess it up. The Biafra we seek will never be like Nigeria. It won't be one federal feeding bottle system of government. Biafra will comprise of nations. A people united in purpose. We shall know our differences and treasure it. There will be no shouts of one Biafra, for Biafra is a coming together of many nations. In this Biafra you will make your laws and in your own language. You will take charge of your resources and control commerce. Your local language can be elevated to become your means of communication. And you can chose to exit Biafra at anytime through a referendum. I am not making this up. I have heard the IPOB leader say them. This means that no one will build your own part of Biafra for you except you. I used the last sit at home to determine the level of acceptance for our freedom. And I found out that Ijaw as a people are still lagging behind in terms of setting themselves free from this zoo. Some of their youths are still engrossed with politics and listening to politicians that have looted them dry. These politicians lie to them that Igbo is their problem, while they keep looting them. There is every need to teach every Ijaw child to understand that there is no hope for him or her in Nigeria. Judging from the last sit at home, I can tell you that the average Ijaw man is still far from embracing freedom. And this is pathetic. Those of them fooling themselves about Niger Delta Republic of entire South South should wake up already. I even wonder why no one is actually fighting for Niger Delta Republic, no leader, no protest, but once any of them hears Biafra, they will remember Niger Delta Republic. You must understand that Nigeria in other to downsize the Igbo people carved them into what they called South South. I watched these Igbo people from Rivers, Delta to Benue observe last Monday Sit At Home. This will tell you that all Igbo people are united in Biafra. I am not saying you can't have your Niger Delta Republic, you can have it, but you have to stop dreaming of having Ndị Igbo in it. You can't love part of Ndị Igbo and hate some. You can't love Ngozi from Egbema in Rivers State and hate Ngozi from Egbema in Imo State. It is never down. You can't fight this alone. Don't say when Igbo people leave, then you will start your own agitation. They won't let you. You must start now to stand for something. You must stop listening to these wicked and selfish leaders. Lies is what they tell you. Igbo youths had to depart from the their leaders before they saw light. You must do the same. If you need your own Nation, it is more feasible in Biafra. Don't wait to be begged. Don't wait to be consulted, for no one consulted anyone of us. And no one will Bribe you to accept freedom. Thank God MNK said it already that every nation in Biafra will vote differently during referendum. Meaning that those that say they are not Biafrans will have the opportunity to vote themselves out. Come Monday 16th, we will again observe another referendum and you will agree with me that Igbo people both in South East and South South have decided that it is Biafra or Biafra.

This was an article I wrote on the 20th of August 2019, I posted it on KEMI's blog as one of her top fans, to register my displeasure to her , because her attacks on the Leader of IPOB ; Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and the people of Biafrans, and as expected she blocked me after reading the post , and avoided me as a plague. I was one of her to fans , please read and remember her in your prayers , she is possessed. ""KEMI:THE CRAFTY SERPENT OF THE ZOO"" The old serpent of the book of Genesis is renowned for its craftiness at deceiving the gullible by twisting lies to appear as truth, and twisting the truth to appear as lies. Twisted lies and twisted truth, these are her potent weapons. Kemi a Yoruba journalist and a Doctor, someone one who many believe is engaged in investigative journalism, posted so many articles and video on her blog through her foot soldiers , as some one who needs help financially for reason of her health challenges, she was able to attract attention and enough traffic on her blog. Today she is healed of all her trauma, thanks to heaven. I understand that some people did not contribute enough fund as expected especially Biafrans. Her friends organised a birthday bash to mark her birthday, I guess too, Biafrans did not contribute much towards that. Today Kemi, has concluded her investigative journalism on the alleged rape case involving the COSA pastor. It is time for KEMI to attack IPOB through her blog that has attracted so many traffic especially Biafrans , firstly, by emphasising on her health challenges to attract sympathy and fund and feed her numerous fans with junk news about her perceived enemies. Kemi is now attacking IPOB by echoing the gaffe of the contraption that a renowned most peaceful mass freedom fighting outfit ever to emerge out of Africa; IPOB is a terrorist group. Kemi in her post accused Mazi Nnamdi Kanu of being the cause of Sowore's problem. My questions to Kemi. Have you ever done any investigative journalism on the current issues bedevilling the country, The Boko Haram, the Fulani herdsmen, the bandits on our high ways? Did you ever utter any word, inform of a press statement on the killing of the daughter of the leader of Afenifere? Have you done your investigative journalism to know why IPOB is agitating for restoration of Biafra ? Have you caught any IPOB member , with arms before you begin to shout terrorist, terrorist , terrorist? Did Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in way summoned Sowore to visit him in the States for a discussion on issues concerning your Nigeria? As someone who is educated, when did a call for self determination mean terrorism in English language or even in your Nigeria constitution ? If IPOB is a terrorist group, have they killed any one in your village, how many women did they rape in your community? Why are you angered by the fact that most of your Biafrans friends did not contribute enough to your franchise when you already know they are terrorists? Are you not a terrorist by expecting donations from terrorists? Sowore was your favourite candidate in the last presidential election, why did you suddenly abandon him, now that he needed young people like you to protest against the security situation, and other socio economic problems in your beloved Nigeria? Is IPOB and Biafra the reason Nigeria is in turmoil, are they the reason for poverty in Nigerian, are they the reason many Nigerian youths are dying in Mediterranean Sea on attempt to migrate to Europe for greener pastures ? Are they the reason workers are not well paid or even owed some arrears. When Biafrans were disenfranchised during last presidential election, you were mute ,they were beaten and chased out of the polling units in Lagos state by your brothers and uncles, you were silent waiting for us to retaliate so you all can justify your gaffe with your imbecilic and ridiculous shout, "" terrorist, terrorist ,terrorist"". But deep down your heart you know, we are fighting a just cause. That is why IPOB is a voice to reckon with globally especially in civilised society? I love Sowore for standing up as a man to agitate for the well-being of the Nigerian workers, although I don't believe any more in Nigeria project. If someone like Dr. Kemi can allow ethnic, sentiments, hate and envy to becloud her sense of reasoning, it simply means Nigeria is irreparable. DR. KEMI , your attack on IPOB if care is not taken will affect your international status since your action recently speaks volume of some one living in a medieval age, where opportunists attack the oppressed to get favour and financial gratification from the oppressors. The attack on Ike Ekweremadu is now the topic that journalist want to use to score cheap point ,now that government of Germany is on this case Kemi and her bandwagon of cash and carry journalist can now concentrate on their job.

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR OF RADIO BIAFRA AND BIAFRA TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Biafran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35. Things are now happening in ZOO and I thank Chukwu Okike Abiama for that. 36. People that kept your name away from the people that suffered Genocide, are they going to love you ? 37.

He insists Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, has chosen the wrong method to resolve the herdsmen/host community feud ACJ: In view of the current security challenges in Nigeria and the sudden emergence of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Sunday Igboho, as a freedom fighter, where do you stand, and what is your view about Mr. Igboho’s agitation? I will throw back the question to you. Does Sunday Igboho have any agenda? What is that agenda? From what perspective is he fighting for the freedom of Yoruba? If it is from the standpoint of the herdsmen, then we should narrow it down to whether he wants all the herdsmen to quit our land or not? What does he really want? I ask these questions because beyond the herdsmen problem, there are other challenges. Are we now saying that there shouldn’t be recourse to the government or traditional rulers again while trying to find a solution? I will never support self-help because in most cases it gets out of hand and will lead people to a greater crisis. Having stated this, let me put it on record that I frown at and reject in totality any act from any set of people that is capable of threatening the security of Nigeria. I will also not be in support of anybody or a group of people that are making attempts to foment trouble in any part of Nigeria. I am of the opinion that there should be a thought process mechanism that would involve the security operatives, the traditional rulers, the government, and other stakeholders in addressing our security problem. Nigeria as a brand or as a nation is so important in the black race to be thrown into war. Like other concerned Yoruba people, there are bad ones among the herdsmen, but it will be wrong to classify all of them as bad. There are bad ones among Igbos and there are good ones. Likewise, there are bad ones among the Yoruba and there are good ones. In view of this, let us work towards investigating and apprehending culprits and punishing them, rather than resorting to blanket threats that could lead to anarchy in the country. So, for people like Sunday Igboho to get my support, the approach must not be warlike or belligerent. I hate to hear statements like; “I want to free the Yoruba people from this government”, “we want to secede”, “Fulanis should go” and other related provoking statements. Igboho should have a clear vision instead of playing to the gallery. He should also know that it will be difficult for him to singlehandedly champion the cause of identifying the kidnappers among the Fulanis or any other tribe without the support of other stakeholders. Nigeria is not a zoo but a federated country with a constitution. I have also urged my people in Yorubaland not to follow anybody blindly. Much as I want Nigeria's security problems to be addressed, I don’t want anybody to gang up against a particular ethnic group because I also have Iwo sons and daughters spread across the country and I don’t want anybody to gang against them. Happily for me, I have my children in the north and they're well to do, they are not even herders or cart pushers; some are doctors, some are lawyers, we have engineers, there are professors. It will interest you that there is no institution of higher learning in the north without a southerner as lecturers and we have many institutions in the South without a single person from the north. Are we now saying that if a Yoruba man commits an offense in the north, all these people should be wiped off? It shouldn’t be. ACJ: Kabiyesi, what is then the way out? I have said it, the way out is for all stakeholders to come to the drawing board and reason together on how best to fish out culprits among the Fulanis. Are all herders criminals? The question is no. Then let's apply wisdom and go back to that popular Yoruba saying; ‘Ika to ba se, l’Oba nge’, which can roughly be translated to mean that law should be applied to whoever that commits the crime. To me, it’s wrong to tag only an ethnic group as perpetrators of kidnapping. There are Yorubas and there are Igbos who are also involved in the nefarious practices. For instance, if you are talking about kidnappers, the last time I checked my books, the richest and the most celebrated kidnapper in Nigeria is an Igbo man called Evans. Now, can we say because of what Evans did and confessed to having done, should we force all the Igbos out of Yoruba or Hausaland? When you forcefully chase out from your domain people who have lived there for, between 50 and 100 years and all that they go away with are backpacks, then you have sinned against humanity. I felt sad when I saw children and women being pursued as if we were in a war situation.

This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU!

After the cancellation of the sit at home by IPOB, Biafrans got a point to destabilise the lies coming from Nigeria media against IPOB, for it is insanity to enforce a sit at home that has already been cancelled. The government had to close this gap and to do that they employed the services of those that call themselves autopiloters. These autopiloters led by Mr Ekpa have worked with Nigeria government to terrorize Biafrans and make the people hate their own freedom and work against their own freedom. They won't their actions to be pinned on IPOB. This is why IPOB must have to single out autopiloters and inform Biafrans who they are. Autopiloters are anti Biafra, anti IPOB and anti Nnamdi Kanu.

Some dubious rich men from the East are worried that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is almost getting closer to ending their cash cow called One Nigeria.

These dubious rich men are against ending one Nigeria and are already spending a lot of money towards this end.

According to them, the people are already with Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and the only way to get the people from standing with Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is to hit the peoople hard.

The info said that these dubious men are planning to attack markets and places where our people are doing business and brand it ESN.

Remember that this is not the North planning, but some dubious men among us planning against our own people. They are eager to make us remain in chains because of their selfish desires and gains.

One thing we must understand is that few of our people are gaining a lot out of our collective sufferings and pains. This is why they hate Nnamdi Kanu. They feel that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is about to end their illegal and dubious businesses. They know the amount of corruption they embark on inside a corrupt One Nigeria. A type of corruption that is capable of gifting them billions in 6 months.

Lots of us don't really know why we have many enemies standing against Biafra Restoration. Some don't understand why many big heads are against Biafra freedom. Your pain is their gain, your freedom is their lose. That is the summary of it all. 

Our people must be mentally strong. For us to be free, we must not allow these people to manipulate us. We should understand that no Igbo man can attack our people in the market or church. Once such a thing happens, know that the hands of the enemy is inside. This is why I still call what happened in Ozubulu some years back a terrorist attack. No Igbo will go to a church during morning Mass and open fire on worshippers. We know what our people can do and not do.

Any attack on our people in their markets or religious places is done by our enemies. No two ways about it. 

Be Vigilant, send this to every one of our people. Teach it in schools, markets and churches. Our people must be aware.

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25.

Just under seven weeks of a lockdown, and you are already screaming of hunger and begging for palliatives from Buhari. Let me assure you that whatever hardships or inconvenience you think you are suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer if war ever breaks out as a result of the ""Biafra or death"", ""Islamization"", ""Fulani jihad"", ""Fulanization"", and ""Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria"" propaganda churned out by Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF etc, and your spiritual Papas and Daddy G.Os. They have been beating the drums of propaganda and war with a very big stick, and you have been dancing furious steps to the rhythms. They tell you that Buhari wants to Islamize Nigeria, and you cheer. They say Buhari is the one arming and sending Fulani herdsmen to kill you, and you scream delightedly. They say Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria, and you believe them. They say Buhari wants to kill every Southerner along with those in the Middle-Belt, and give the vacant land to his Fulani kinsmen, and you agree. They incite the Igbos against other Nigerians, and you rejoice. They incite Christians against Muslims, and you dance for joy. They abuse Northerners and Muslims and Fulanis and the Yorubas, and you celebrate. You call Fulanis and Northerners cows. You call Nigeria a zoo and other Nigerians animals in the zoo. They tell you to get ready to fight a war and defend yourselves and your land against the Sokoto Caliphate and the sons of Usman Dan Fodio, and you scream in excitement. They call the Fulanis bloodthirsty demons from Futa Jallon, and you are giddy with delight. This is the rubbish that the PDP, CAN, NCEF, your Pastors and Daddy G.Os, Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Reno Omokri, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle-Belt forum, South-South Leaders Forum, PANDEF, etc, have been feeding you with for ages, and you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker, instead of using your braino like rational beings. They have politicised religion and weaponised it as a tool of political blackmail. They have been playing the religious card in a very dangerous and reckless manner since 2014, viciously fanning the smouldering embers of ethno-tribal and religious divisions and hatred. I want to announce to you that if and when the conflagration ignites, whatever you think you're suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer in a war situation. You are screaming for palliatives now, but nobody will give you palliatives in a war situation. I heard that in some parts of the Country, the prices of foodstuffs have risen astronomically. For example, a paint bucket of garri is now selling at N1800 in some parts of the country. The cost of satchets and bags of ""Pure Water"" have doubled. In a war situation, you will buy a paint bucket of garri for N10,000 or more, i.e if you could even see it to buy. Let me not talk about the other staples like yam, beans, rice, cassava, etc. A wrap of ""Akpu"" may cost as much as N1000. You will buy a loaf of bread for N7000, assuming it is even available. You have been shouting ""hunger"" and "" hardship"" since Buhari came to power, but in a war situation, you will know what ""hunger"" and ""hardship"" is. Then you will realize that what you are currently experiencing is Paradise in comparison. You are complaining that you are tired of staying at home because of the lockdown. In a war situation, you will most likely not even have a home to stay in; you will be too busy running for your life or hiding in the bush or the forest, or living in a refugee camp. You are complaining that health facilities are poor; in a war situation, there will be no hospitals to go to, because many of them will be bombed or razed to the ground, and the few available ones will be overflowing with war casualties. Believe you me, those your Daddy G.Os and Spiritual Papas will hop on their private jets and fly out of the Country if and when those embers of ethno-tribal and religious hate they have been fanning ignite, and leave you to face the music.

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE NIGERIAN SENATE ON THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IN NIGERIA By Rev Fr Angelo Unegbu Dear honourable members of the Nigerian Senate, I have contemplated for more than two years now on writing you this letter but the likelihood that my request may fall on deaf ears has always discouraged me. But as the Nigerian situation has gone with a speed of light from worse to worst, more than we have ever imagined. I am compelled by the biting hardship, too many pains, suffering and deaths of Nigerians to write you without delay. And I do hope that my words are taken seriously. My honourable men and women, do you even realize that you are merely keeping watch over a collapsed country or a failed state? In case you do not know, a country is known to be a failed or collapsed state when: 1) it can no longer guarantee the safety of lives and property; 2) it can no longer better the lives of its citizens by creating jobs; 3) it can no longer provide basic amenities like electricity, good roads, water and so on; 4) government institutions like judiciary, police, are inefficient and no longer reliable; 5) there is total collapse of governance; 4) there are no hopes among the citizens that the situation will ever get better; In a failed state, leadership loses its function and meaning. Leaders are replaced by war lords. Only the man with gun is obeyed. Thus, in a failed state, there is no difference between a policeman or a soldier or any uniform man with a gun and an armed robber. It becomes like life in the jungle. None has any respect for their victim in a collapsed state. No one is ever afraid of the consequences of his or her actions. The presumption is that one is likely to go unpunished when he or she commits a crime or even kills an innocent citizen. It is needless blaming any political party because political parties do not exist in a failed state. Rather, what you have are gangs or hijackers of power who will be changing their group-belongingness, disbanding and regrouping with impunity. Manifestoes of such groups or parties are unknown or irrelevant. Common national interests do not exist in such groups, rather individual interests. In a failed state, whoever has the power will clutch it so tightly that it never slips off his or her hands. It is only in a failed state that politics becomes a dirty game. Technocrats, men and women ""without liver"" stay clear. It is nothing but a fight of the titans; a sad return to the Hobbesian ‘state of nature.’ In a failed state people die like flies. Justice and the rule of law are unknown. Killings and sudden disappearance of citizens become the order of the day. In a failed state, there is no meaningful opposition and where they even manage to exist, they are brutally crushed at once. Failed states do not tolerate demonstrations, civil disobedience, strikes and agitations unless when carried out in support of the people in power. Citizens live in permanent fear and forget their rights as citizens. In a failed state excellence is sacrificed at the altar of mediocrity; leadership is marred with ineptitude; education and healthcare are in miserable state. The economy is in shambles. In a failed state, elections are marred with violence and processes are incredibly uncivil. Given such a scenario people lose faith in the government. In a failed state, the laws of the land are no longer supreme. They become tools in the hands of leaders for witch-hunting their enemies and beatifying their friends. The consequences of all these is that children grow up with hate and detestation for their nation. Adults give up hope. Everyone sees it as hell. No one would want to stay. Foreign investors and tourists are scared. The situation worsens day by day but the government in a failed state will continue to give an opposite impression of their country to avoid external intervention. Dear honourable members of the Nigerian Senate, let us look for a radical and perennial solution to our problems otherwise we move from pieces to dust. No matter what bills you pass, no matter what you say or do, as long the country is not restructured or peacefully divided, nothing else will save Nigeria from a complete drowning. Any resources spent on trying to save Nigeria from its present predicament will only amount to waste of money, energy and time unless the root of the matter is addressed, namely the present structure of Nigeria. The country should be reordered and governed according to how people belong together, with respectful and orderly channels of contact to maintain our national identity and interests. Things that do not belong together cannot be forced together. It is a simple law of nature. Even in the zoo all animals are not put together. Imagine that Italians are to be forced to have one government with the Germans and French, it would also be a disaster. Their economy would also be miserable like ours today. Even Belgians are wise (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/breakingtimesng/photos/a.1016525348412391/5363656633699219/?type=3,,,,,,,,78,-1.29

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened. 3. Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 5. Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man, ignorance, stupidity, jealousy, envy and greed. 6. It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 7. Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 8. I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes . 19. There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 20. Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 21. Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". you see, this is how they roll. 22. That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away, that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 23. Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off, and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 24. Have you ever wondered, your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 25. Thanks to Radio Biafra, people are now listening and have started to reason. 26. Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 27. As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 28. When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 29. The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you. 30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday, and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course. 31. As we always, that Biafra is our Religion, and here on Radio Biafra is where we worship, Elohim Chukwu Okike puru ime ihe n'ile is our God, I thank you all for listening , from me from here, is Goodevening",https://www.facebook.com/risingsunhistory/photos/a.127312028978678/162338192142728/?type=3,,,,,,,,72,1.8

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25.

He insists Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, has chosen the wrong method to resolve the herdsmen/host community feud ACJ: In view of the current security challenges in Nigeria and the sudden emergence of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Sunday Igboho, as a freedom fighter, where do you stand, and what is your view about Mr. Igboho’s agitation? I will throw back the question to you. Does Sunday Igboho have any agenda? What is that agenda? From what perspective is he fighting for the freedom of Yoruba? If it is from the standpoint of the herdsmen, then we should narrow it down to whether he wants all the herdsmen to quit our land or not? What does he really want? I ask these questions because beyond the herdsmen problem, there are other challenges. Are we now saying that there shouldn’t be recourse to the government or traditional rulers again while trying to find a solution? I will never support self-help because in most cases it gets out of hand and will lead people to a greater crisis. Having stated this, let me put it on record that I frown at and reject in totality any act from any set of people that is capable of threatening the security of Nigeria. I will also not be in support of anybody or a group of people that are making attempts to foment trouble in any part of Nigeria. I am of the opinion that there should be a thought process mechanism that would involve the security operatives, the traditional rulers, the government, and other stakeholders in addressing our security problem. Nigeria as a brand or as a nation is so important in the black race to be thrown into war. Like other concerned Yoruba people, there are bad ones among the herdsmen, but it will be wrong to classify all of them as bad. There are bad ones among Igbos and there are good ones. Likewise, there are bad ones among the Yoruba and there are good ones. In view of this, let us work towards investigating and apprehending culprits and punishing them, rather than resorting to blanket threats that could lead to anarchy in the country. So, for people like Sunday Igboho to get my support, the approach must not be warlike or belligerent. I hate to hear statements like; “I want to free the Yoruba people from this government”, “we want to secede”, “Fulanis should go” and other related provoking statements. Igboho should have a clear vision instead of playing to the gallery. He should also know that it will be difficult for him to singlehandedly champion the cause of identifying the kidnappers among the Fulanis or any other tribe without the support of other stakeholders. Nigeria is not a zoo but a federated country with a constitution. I have also urged my people in Yorubaland not to follow anybody blindly. Much as I want Nigeria's security problems to be addressed, I don’t want anybody to gang up against a particular ethnic group because I also have Iwo sons and daughters spread across the country and I don’t want anybody to gang against them. Happily for me, I have my children in the north and they're well to do, they are not even herders or cart pushers; some are doctors, some are lawyers, we have engineers, there are professors. It will interest you that there is no institution of higher learning in the north without a southerner as lecturers and we have many institutions in the South without a single person from the north. Are we now saying that if a Yoruba man commits an offense in the north, all these people should be wiped off? It shouldn’t be. ACJ: Kabiyesi, what is then the way out? I have said it, the way out is for all stakeholders to come to the drawing board and reason together on how best to fish out culprits among the Fulanis. Are all herders criminals? The question is no. Then let's apply wisdom and go back to that popular Yoruba saying; ‘Ika to ba se, l’Oba nge’, which can roughly be translated to mean that law should be applied to whoever that commits the crime. To me, it’s wrong to tag only an ethnic group as perpetrators of kidnapping. There are Yorubas and there are Igbos who are also involved in the nefarious practices. For instance, if you are talking about kidnappers, the last time I checked my books, the richest and the most celebrated kidnapper in Nigeria is an Igbo man called Evans. Now, can we say because of what Evans did and confessed to having done, should we force all the Igbos out of Yoruba or Hausaland? When you forcefully chase out from your domain people who have lived there for, between 50 and 100 years and all that they go away with are backpacks, then you have sinned against humanity. I felt sad when I saw children and women being pursued as if we were in a war situation.

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU! Long live Nnamdi Kanu!! I love Ohamadike so much no matter your sentiments Kuchoo Chequas-Och",https://www.facebook.com/biafraornothing/photos/a.1618240355059420/2525299867686793/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Flogin%252F%253Fnext%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.facebook.com%25252Flogin%25252F%25253Fnext%25253Dhttps%2525253A%2525252F%2525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252Flogin%2525252F%2525253Fnext%2525253Dhttps%252525253A%252525252F%252525252Fwww.facebook.com%252525252Flogin%252525252F%252525253Fnext%252525253Dhttps%25252525253A%25252525252F%25252525252Fwww.facebook.com%25252525252Flogin%25252525252F%25252525253Fnext%25252525253Dhttps%2525252525253A%2525252525252F%2525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252525252Flogin%2525252525252F%2525252525253Fnext%2525252525253Dhttps%252525252525253A%252525252525252F%252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%252525252525252Flogin%252525252525252F%252525252525253Fnext%252525252525253Dhttps%25252525252525253A%25252525252525252F%25252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%25252525252525252Flogin%25252525252525252F%25252525252525253Fnext%25252525252525253Dhttps%2525252525252525253A%2525252525252525252F%2525252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252525252525252Fbiafraornothing%2525252525252525252Fphotos%2525252525252525252Fa.1618240355059420%2525252525252525252F2525299867686793%2525252525252525252F%2525252525252525253Ftype%2525252525252525253D3,,,,,,,65,-1.69

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom(Ada Biafra) 1. Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Tonight if your coming to listen to us, bring your pen and paper. If you are JANJAWEED, bring your chalk and slate. 3. Whenever i try to teach, I teach subjects that are incontrovertible. 4. We have the ability to reason on a continuous level . 5. Biafra is not like any other nation of the world and we make no apologies to that . 6. The greatest injustice anybody can do to you is to hide the truth from you. 7. What is happening today we foretold it, and we knew they will happen. 8. They so called men of God are afraid because they are not sure of what they are preaching. Instead all they are concerned about is tithes and Offerings. 9. I am saying this too because I am a Christian, controversial, but I will tell you why in short while, why all of us are Christians. 10. What am about to tell you this evening, no pastor knows the meaning of Christianity. Those that knows from Rome, hides it away from you. This night I will tell you. 11. People in Nigga area in Katsina went to do the same protest that you are doing around the world in the name of ""black lives matters"", the organizer of the same protest in Katsina Nastiwa Sharif, was arrested. 12. Amnesty international has reported that they have arrested this man because he is crying out about the killings of his people by bandits. 13. Not all advice from old people you should listen. Some old people grows old. 14. Nobody is more Christian than me. Listen attentively. The best place to start is ,who is a Christian?. According google, Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic teachings of Jesus christ. Meaning the religion teaching of one God. 15. What is the meaning of monotheism, ONE GOD. The same God that Judaism believes in. 16. During the time of Yeshua. The meaning of Yeshua is Chizoba, God saves. 17. The problem with the churches in Nigeria is that you steal money, and you kept quiet. You don't condemn the killings in Nigeria . 18. If not for Urigadari we wouldn't have had mobile phones today. The white people were superstitious like Africans we wouldn't have the mobile phones . 19. The name we bear is enough for me to know that God is real. I don't need a white man to teach me that. 20. My aim is to educate all these criminals, and fake people. 21. Do you actually know the meanig of Israel? It simply means the PRINCE OF GOD. 22. my aim is to educate and not to castigate anybody. Jesus prayed to ""my father in heaven"" so why don't you do what jesus have done? 23. What Europe has done over the years is wherever they go and see the children of light they will deny them their history. 24. Had the Israelites allowed themselves to be bamboozled, will there be israel today? 25. There is a place in Arochukwu called Ihechiowa, the place of light . 26. I told you that Biafra is the kingdom of God on earth. Everywhere they are answering light . How else do you need me to tell you that you are special. 27. And when I see all these blessed children of Biafra going to all these churches pastored by the former Moslems. 28. And then somebody is answering the name ""darkness"", nigga area and you want me to accept them? 29. Do you know why they hate us? because God said that darkness and light does not believe together. And you expect to be accepted by Nigeria which is a darkness? 30. Can you see why I have a problem with someone who answers Niger Delta. And someone wake up and call you darkness. 31. Lugard knows exactly what he was doing when he named you, ""the Great Biafra"" 32. Look at Sourh Africa, who made it beautiful? A white man. Immediately the whites handed over to black people they are backwards like other African countries. 33. You dont have sewage systems, we build a house we kept digging pits for toilets. 34. I want people to understand that we have proof for the migration of people from Israel. 35. The book of Zephaniah 3:10 says, after Ethipiopia you will see my people there. Look at the map, after Ethiopia is Biafara. 36. This is the book you carry everyday, the word of God and you go to those who does not know God to teach you the word of God. 37. The book of Zephaniah 3:10 , says from beyond Ethiopia, and after Ethiopia is the kingdom of Biafara the name of my village, Afara. 38. IPOB is light , the ZOO Nigga area is darkness. 39. Why I am upset with Yoruba is that they are Learned, they went to school, and yet they cannot reason. 40. Fulanis are busy impregnating 6 year olds in the North, these are the bastards you want to be with. 41. They are raping 6 year old children in Nigga area, and you said that you are a Nigerian? These are the people your daddy G.O wants you to be with. 42. Your real name is Nigerian, that's your real name. Funny enough that's a name that has been banned, but that is a name of a country in Africa.

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.

If anybody can wake up one day and insult a race as great as Yoruba and we've some elements backing him for political reasons, then the bastard child just woke up. You can't abuse my father and expect me to respect you. APC is a political party and not a race, Yoruba is not a political party, therefore the difference is clear.

Those who came to kill us shall kill themselves. 9. Nasir El Rufai is the chief sponsor of Bokoharam, and all the killer group in the ZOO so said a newspaper article. 10. Some of you don't know that Kastina is an Hausa land that was taking over by the Fulani conquest, due to the stupidity of the HAUSA. 11. For those of you who are championing the Fulani agenda and conquest of our land, I want to warn you to see what is happening in Kastina. 12. I want every Saboteurs to understand, both those with feeding bottle and those Presiding over nkwobi, that Kastina is Hausa land which the seeded to the Fulani and today Fulanis are still killing them today. 13. Nature is designed that the strong will eat the weak, and that is why a lion can cheat and eat other animals. 14. For those of you that are looking to this shirad you called the ZOO Presidency, I want you to look at the HAUSA race and see how Fulanis are killing them 15. I want all these people talking Rubbish to understand that all these their effort to sabotage our people will backfire. 16. There is a video I am going to play where our son called traditional leaders are sharing money from the Fulani. What they are doing today, their children will pay for it in the future. 17. This is a lesson i want Orji Uzo Kalu to learn, this is the lesson I want the supreme court governor in Imo state to learn. 18. Our children will be killed in EBONYI, our children will be killed in Abia, and our children will be killed in IMO. 19. This is a very big lesson for all you Saboteurs, you are putting our race into danger. 20. All of you are behaving like Azikiwe , when Mbonu Ojike warned him but he refused. 21. We were killed before and nobody faced trial, even the fool Gowon that chaired the killing is walking around asking you to pray. 22. The mistake that the Hausas made we cannot afford to make., ""maka na onye ndi iro gbara gburu gburu na eche ndu ya nche"" 23. Britain hate us with passion, and that is why they set up the Willys commission to divide us. 24. The same British defiled the laws of geography and came down to the confluence of Omambara and say that Biafra started here. 25. Britain saw all the Pyramids in Enugu and Britain said if we allow this people to be free the light will come into Africa , and Britain swore. 26. I want us to be very sober and reflective tonights, because there are decisions you make today that will come to bite you in the future. 27. The same thing Orji Uzo kalu is uttering now about igbo Presidency, Azikiwe did the same Rubbish and look at where we are today. 28. Now tell me , in a country that claim to be a democracy is actively involved in Terrorism which Britain is part of it. 29. Bokoharam and bandits are the same ones engaged in killing civilians and then other one is to engage the military, to secure the ZOO for their children and children children. 30. Why did Ortom said , that ""we have failed nigeria "" 31. Do you know why Facebook removed my post is because I told Britain to look at the nigga they created. 32. Their plan is to depopulate our land, their plan is to kill us all and nobody will come to our aid. 33. Somebody is telling you not to defend yourself, are you not an idiot? 34. Do you know the reason why they insisted that Hope Uzodima becomes the Governor? You don't know but I will tell you tonight. 35. Because of the next Ohaneze leader, that's why they put Uzodima there. 36. Now listen to the problem of our people, you know this Ohaneze people , you try to rehabilitate them yet they refused to be rehabilitate. 37. I asked them a simple question, if you see any Efulefu, ask him, have you seen any Yoruba man come out to condem OPC? 38. But you people that kept on coming out sabotaging your people, have you gotten anything? The answer is No. 39. He will remain the supreme court Governor and that will remain his name forever. 40. People need to understand that islam must expand is a natural phynominal. 41. I have said it before , that Biafra must come or we all die. As am saying it, you can cut it out and send it to whomever you wish to send it to 42.

.
* I start this evening by going straight into what is happening in Biafraland and Edo State. The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition.
* The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds.
* Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes.
* When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot.
* I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly.
* Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims.
* Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order!
* Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites.
* I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints?
* The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency.
* Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate.
* When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land?
* Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation.
* I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there.
* In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed.
* Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it.
* Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri. We are the descendants of Gad. Go to your history book and make your (truncated)",,,,58,-2.86

Opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. I say good evening to some of you, as I welcome you, I want you to welcome others. 3. My people in Akwa-Ibom they say ""Abasi mbong"" our people in urhobo say Tamuno. 4. I want you to pay attention to what I have to say this evening. 5. You have heard this clip before very many years ago and I want you to hear what this JANJAWEED has to say. 6. I want to prove all beyond every reasonable doubt that Fulani is the problem. 7. As I play this audio, somebody should put it on my page, that the world will know that Fulani never meant Nigeria to work from day one. 8. Buhari was following the footsteps of sardauna of Sokoto. 9. What this man said since 1950 is still active in our life today. 10. I am going to play the voice of this man again so that you can understand that this whole thing was planned years ago. 11. I want Wike, I want Ozodimgba to listen to me very well. 12. What APC is carrying out today was laid down before 1960. 13. Britain knew that Fulani hated igbo people because Britain hated igbo people. Why Britain hated igbo people is beyond me. 14. The North hates the east, they love the yoruba a little bit. that's why they said they are not leaving. 15. What is this hate or hatred for the Igbo? what has the igbos done? 16. Tribal tension has been there before the 60's and am asking people when will this tension stop? 17. A white man is asking a black baboon from Africa why do you hate a black man like you. 18. I want to prove to efulefus in the Zoo how the hatred in the Zoo today was brought. 19. Igbo people are ancient people ""ndi gboo"" that is why the are occupying the centre of the world. 20. Biafra is beyond what man can understand. 21. How did they dominate you, because everywhere they go to even a white man will ask them to run their work. 22. When you hear other tribe joining them to castigated Biafra don't blame them, anybody who is castigating Biafra will not make heaven. 23. This happened in the late 40's and Buhari has replicated the same northernisation and fulanisation. 24. Now let me prove it to you that what this man is saying over 60 years ago is still active today. 25. I have given you the first Fulani Gordy agenda of Fulanisation headed by Amadu Bello a reprobate. 26. The daughter of Abba Kyari is the one controlling the whole money of the Zoo and all of you are there shouting one Nigeria like mad people. 27. How God sent the unknown gun men we don't know but we are praying for them. 28. Let me remind some of you fools like Hope Uzodima. He said we hijacked ESN. 29. Hope Uzodima don't you wear Pampers and your fellow men are busy destroying you. 30. When they invite you to Sokoto that night you start sweating because you know what they will do you in the night. 31. NO MORE FUND RAISING IN THE ZOO, YOU ARE SOLDIERS YOU STAY IN THE BUSH UNTIL YOU ARE REFILLED . 32. On this note we have come to the end of this programme. Here on Radio Biafra is where we worship and Chukwu Okike Abiama is our God. From me from here is Good evening.

An opening prayer said by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. If you have joined us this evening you should be able to listen to us via my facebook page. The most persecuted page, and they have now taken the same to my Twitter account. 3. I can announce to you this evening that we have a new family in the Seychelles. 4. I am the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Director of Radio Biafra. 5. We must now proceed to preach this gospel that Elohim tasked us to preach. 6. The only place on this planet earth where there is coal, gas and oil. The only place is Biafraland. 7. This evening, if you have any Biafran army in the ZOO army you better start looking for them, because the news we are getting is not favorable. 8. They are now selecting Biafran soldiers and transferring them to the North, Borono to be precisely. 9. They are killing our people as am addressing you tonight, if you have any Biafran soldiers in the ZOO army, better start looking for them now not tomorrow. 10. They were seen inside the barracks with our brothers sitting on the floor waiting to be transfered to Borono. 11. This evening we are placing the whole world on alart. If you have any relatives serving in the ZOO army, and you don't look for them now it will be too late by tomorrow. 12. I want the DSS to know tonight that there is nothing they are planning tonight that we are not privy to. 13. So before you put your heads to what you don't know, ask your friends in the army and police how far. 14. You people are terrorist in uniform, you want to help the JANJAWEED to conquer our land. 15. You want to come to Biafraland to abduct our coordinators, and i say come and abduct our people and see the stuff we are made of. 16. Before you will come and arrest and kill our people and we cry and you walk out free, now come and kill let God punish you all. 17. Any idiot that will come to Biafraland to kill, come and kill and you will die. 18. IT IS A DIRECT INSTRUCTIO18. IT IS A DIRECT INSTRUCTION TO ALL VOLUNTEERS!!!! ANY FULANI YOU SEE, BOTH WITH THE VEHICLES THEY COME WITH MUST BE BURNT DOWN!!! ALLOW THEM TO COME IN AND THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE ROUTE !!!!! 19. AND THE DAY WE CATCH SABO!!! WE WILL SET AN EXAMPLE WITH YOU THAT THE WORLD WILL KNOW HOW SERIOUS WE ARE. 20. We know who your informants are, if we don't spare your masters be rest assured that we will not spare you. 21. So REFERENDUM is good for Scotland but not for Biafrans, because we are blacks and you are whites. Blacks are inferior to whites that's the thinking. 22. SS and Scotland yard are not there arresting and killing the people in Scotland, but you want to kill Biafrans for asking for their freedom. 23. Scotland Prime Minister Nicholas Sturge has promised to publish the legislature to guarantee Scotland independence next year. 24. But in your own case they said no, no independence for you. 25. I asked for Osinbajo they went and published someone dancing like Papa Ajasco. 26. This thing Scotland is debating in the open, is the same reason DSS is coming to Enugu to kill Biafrans and the British high commissioner is in Abiuja collecting her own share of Petrol dollar. 27. Why is it that there is a woman sitting in Abuja but Scotland is busy agitating for independence in her own country and she is in Abuja supervising the killings of Biafra. 28. Hypocrisy, if the highest order and that is what we are here to oppose and we must oppose it. 29. Before the white men came there was no place called Nigeria, only if you are an animal. 30. You know a black man has no shame, there is no dignity there is no honor. 31. Anybody who opens their stupid idiotic mouth to say they are niggarian, you are lower than an animal to me, you are fool and a completely idiot. 32. It is good for Scotland, but not good for a Nigerian. 33. They said that a British minister was surprised, they never sent the military and the airforce to go and bomb Scotland. 34. You will hear somebody come on channels TV and say go and bomb them they are miscreant, then I ask, is Nicolas Sturgeon also a miscreant? 35. Kosovo, Ukraine, Mecedonia all free, and all are in Europe, so only whites are allowed to be free, not blacks. 36. Britain, no fighter bomber to Scotland, they dialogued. But if is here in the ZOO, is pursue them and kill them, mad people. 37. Britain thought them how 37. Britain thought them how to kill Biafrans, as they killed our mothers and we never asked questions. 38. I want you to understand why Britain cannot talk, because they hate us they cannot stand us, and the same idiot gave us Anglican church. They gave us bible. 39. Always Britain killed us, they even otted the genocide that killed five million Biafrakilled five million Biafrans. 40. That is why (truncated)",,,,,,,,,57,-1.44

IPOB was the reason Nigeria Election is marred, we determine what happens in the Zoo - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu I told them to sign my document they said i don't respect elders but i am also an elder - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Our people are very easy to be very cheap and that is only when you tell them the truth, they will then come out in mass to support you - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Any day i wake up and did not pray for you or did not think about restoring Biafra, if Chukwu Okike Abiama did not take my life away i will know that he is not God - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. When i was arrested in 2015, my people blocked the river Niger bridge for completely 4 days, i didn't pay them they did it because am telling them the truth and they love me for that, i will surely never disappoint them because Biafra must be restored - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Some of you are angry because we lifted the boycott and you don't have PVC, but you do not know that those who do not collect their PVC are the best reason why they signed our document - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. We held the Zoo by the balls and they signed our document, who tell you that Chukwu Okike Abiama is not great? - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu When the terms and condition they signed is published i assure you many of them will commit suicide, i assure you that - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The zoo said they will kill me if i evangelize but the only courage i have is whenever i look back, my people are always with me that is my only courage - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Know this tonight that i am nothing without IPOB family, you made me who i am today and i promise i will never let you down - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu If you are in this hall tonight you are very lucky because you are going to experience another dimension of this very struggle and will be counted among those that restored Biafra - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. I am not God but a human being who can make a mistake, but please when you want to correct me do it with love and emotion not with envy and jealousy or hatred - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Some people are disloyal to my deputy Uche Mefor and i chased them out of IPOB because i respect everyone and hate disloyalty - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu I told England to support Biafra or great calamity befall them and they will never be called United Kingdom again - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. When i was in the prison i curse Nigeria don't you know that? If Britain did not rise up and support Biafra God will punish them, they will suffer - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Orji Uzor Kalu visited me when i was in Kuje prison and asked me to drop Biafra agitation and i ask him how do you intend to liberate our people? He suggested that IPOB should form a political party so that we can win presidency, then i ask him to bring someone that i will surely support him and he refused, then i ask him do you see how the Zoo called Nigeria have eaten you people the so called the Igbo elites? - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Nigeria Kangoroo court/government want to do to me what they did to Uwazuruike, tell me when to eat, when to talk, when to go to bed and when to wake up just to ruin our agitation, but i refused and went for evangelism mad people everywhere in the Kangaroo Nigeria - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Why we did not retaliate the operation Python Dance is because the Zoo wanted to know the type of weapons IPOB have so that they will start killing our people in the North but we are always ahead of them, i asked my people not to attack but today Zoo is collapsing - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. I LIFTED THE ELECTION BOYCOTT FOR TWO THINGS 1. If we had gone with the boycott our land would have been divided, because our people are republicans in nature, they would have said Nnamdi Kanu do not take advice. 2. They would have attributed all violence that happened to IPOB - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu There are so many people working and contributing towards the Biafra restoration that i don't even know, may Elohim bless you all they shall be a great reward for you all and it won't take long time - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.

Ali Ndume is a Fulani janjaweed politician, listen to what he have to say about Nigeria, the video is everywhere, from their we will proceed. 4. Our enemies who are within are using the name of Biafra, their aim is to delay the coming of Biafra in order to please their masters. We have discovered their tactics and we are ready to defeat them. 5. Ali Ndume said they deceived people, that they are not honest. He is telling you that all of them are bad including Nigerians themselves. 6. It is their job to decieve you, it is their job to make sure you have no education. It is their job to make sure you have no jobs. Nigerians instead of fighting for their freedom, are busy fighting those fighting for them. 7. We must not get discouraged. Our determination is unquestionable. 8. If you are wondering how evil a black man can be, Ali Ndume is a good pointer. Ali Ndume is a man accused of sponsoring Boko Haram. 9. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down as a people, that is the reason why it has been easy for the Fulani janjaweed to invade our land, kill us and divide us at will. 10. They will do whatever they can to make you feel what you are doing is not working but believe you me, we are holding them at a very bad place. 11. Britain started this very concerted effort to make sure that Biafra did not see the light of the day when they found out we are the descendants of Israel that will bring light to Africa. 12. Another problem that we have is Igbo man's love for gossip and affinity to back-bite which have to do with greed, envy and jealousy that is why you have Fulanis' in our homes, bushes and markets. 13. Before the Fulani janjaweed decided to take over our land, they bribed every major media house in the world, BBC and Co. Now that they are invading, have you heard about it anywhere in the world analyzing this influx into Biafra territory?. 14. There is a global effort not to allow Biafra to emerge and the Igbo man is not helping either. These are the issues concerning us as a people and it is my duty to let the world know of it. 15. There are many things we do not appreciate or understand, that is why when we preach we use historical references that when you listen, you can never doubt it. 16. Igbo man are their own greatest enemy, when the enemy is busy planning how to take over your land, you are busy gossiping, carrying envy and being jealous. 17. Saboteurs are hiding under the name Niger Delta to delay Biafra. Anybody referring to himself as a Niger Delta, God in heaven knows you are a traitor, their job is to distract us. To make you not to come together to articulate on how to get out of the mess you are into. 18. Biafra is the second most hated people in the whole world apart from Israel. People see you and they hate you for no reason. They see the favour of God on us and they hate us. 19. If you think you are safe, just know we are surrounded. 20. The more they reduce the numbers of our listeners on Facebook, the more I preach. You think this is 1967?. When our people were intimidated by the media, as Biafrans were being massacred, you were busy lying to the world using the media - BBC. 21. Nnia Nwodo and the rest of them never rose up to challenge the issue of artificial boundary by Gowon. 22. Chukwu Okike Abiama said Biafra can never come until you go and unite all my people together. 23. It was remaining only six more months to the Biafra war and we stopped during the war, President Nixton was about to step in but Chukwu Okike Abiama made it so. 24. Once you divide the land of Biafra, Elohim will depart from us his glory will never be with you. This is what our so called elders should have considered. 25. In Otaka village in Obubua Local Government Area in Cross River State they have four market days, they circumcise their children on the eight day. They celebrate new yam festival. 26. Not that we want to force anybody to join Biafra, but we must complete the assignment Heaven gave to us. He will have to shine his light in them so they decide where to belong. 27. Asari Dokubo said he is an Igbo man. No wonder, you said you didn't know who Uchenna Asiegbu is?. Only an Igbo man will deny receiving money after he received it.

My articles are basically for those that want to make heaven, if your desire is not to make heaven after this life, or the old time religion, you would hate my messages. Listen carefully there is no scriptural base for wedding ring in the new covenant and if you doubt show me one scripture. Genesis 35:4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem. We wed two people not with mortal man made instrument but with the invaluable word of God. JOIN THE RAPTURE READY GLOBAL COMMUNITY ON WHATSAPP FOR MORE HEAVENLY MESSAGES LIKE THIS https://chat.whatsapp.com/GuQEfZtKA8OHGuBPBAVQPE How dare you say the symbol of your marriage is a wedding ring instead of the word of God, no wonder there is alot of divorce going on today, if you both cannot leave and stand by the word of God demons won't be afraid some man made rings. If you say you don't put on earrings, attachment, trousers or makeup, you are a hypocrite if you still put on wedding rings. You won't die if you decide to throw them into the lagoon. We are in a generation that believes everything without searching the scriptures, if tomorrow they bring a new style of wedding people with chains, we would still follow all this demonic trend without searching scriptures. From my research the wedding with marriage ring came into use in Christian ceremonies in the 9th century AD. The custom of wearing the wedding the wedding ring on the fourth finger of the left hand is based upon a romantic, although unscientific, Greek fable that the artery from that finger flows directly to the heart. In the kingdom of darkness hand rings are used as symbols of initiation, in the old testament they were used as symbol of authority, prostitution, mostly used by the Egyptian kings and lord's. Rings are also used as sign of slavery and more of idolatry, be wise heaven must cost you this earth, and if you can't remove it for the sake of heaven it only shows that it has become an idol to you. Any church, or preacher that adds or subtract to the word of God would surely face the judgement of God. REV22:19. 1 Peter 3:3 Your adornment must not be merely external--braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; Only the word of God can be used to join a body, soul and spirit. With or without wedding ring if your husband or wife wants to cheat on you he would simply do it by removing the ring. We must labour to teach the people to get born again and intimately no Jesus, this is the only way we can overcome sin. The bible totally condemns any artificial make up on your body, did you ever see God telling Adam and eve with the rings I join you both as husband and wife, what an insult to the wisdom of God. Rome has done so much harm to the church, most of everything we copy are from roman perverted, traditions, cultural festivals, and celebration of Christmas, Easter, lengthen season, many more. GOD IS NOT A RESPECTER OF ANY MAN, HUMBLE YOURSELF, REPENT AND THROW THEM AWAY.

Deji has not been just a critic; he has been everything evil to Kanu and his self-determination seeking group, IPOB. A critic pokes holes in a man’s actions with fact-based alternative opinions, but Deji thrived on calumny, falsehood, malice, assault, hate and an obvious wish for the worst. He spited Kanu time without number, calling him a coward for surviving the attack on his home by the murderous Nigerian military and escaping to Israel for recuperation. To him, Kanu would have stayed back and allow the blood-sucking Nigerian soldiers kill him so that the Biafran dream would be stalled. The vile-filled comrade went so low when, filled with frustration, he did a video in which he expressed an unparalleled hatred for Nnamdi Kanu, showcasing his lying expertise in a manner that could send even Lia Mohammed and his protégé, Femi Adesina, into hiding. Deji’s frustration stemmed from Kanu’s call on Biafrans to boycott the 2019 general elections – a strategy that Obafemi Awolowo himself applied in the sixties. Seeking to ridicule Kanu, he dared to compare self with him (Kanu), claiming that he (Deji) has staged several protests and been arrested many times by Nigerian police yet did not run out from the country. The embittered critic however turned a new leaf after receiving the beating of his life from ordinary almajiris on the street of Abuja and consequentially fleeing to Dubai. Taking to his twitter handle, he wrote, “Let me specially thank Egbon @realFFK for rebuilding the bridge of friendship with my brother Mazi Nnamdi Kanu & yes, I expressed regrets over many of my criticism of him. It’s only in a Zoo that characters like Buhari are fit to be leaders. Nigeria never had it this bad before.” The above tweet thus confirms Femi Fani-Kayode’s earlier assertion that Deji has apologized to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and that Kanu in turn accepted the apology. Pundits believe that, having realized the hopelessness of the animal kingdom called Nigeria, Deji, like Omoyele Sowere, will stand for justice even as his hatred for Biafra remains.

Lagos was never like this before tinubu. This were pictures from the colonial era when the capital of Nigeria was Lagos. Who was tinubu then? Your lack of education has deprived you from right information, there were 5 military regimes before tinubu who served for years, how did you apportion such blame to him. As bad as lagos is today. Show me one Igbo state that can match up in any parameter ? This is why I hate block heads supporting Peter obi. You have no agenda, nothing to say about his credibility or manifesto, all you do is falsely condemn other running mate. If Obi has done 30 percent of what tinubu did in lagos state, Anambra would have been a better place. And let me ask you, why is Obi even contesting for president? I thought Nigeria is a zoo?

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA 1. An opening prayer in the language of heaven by the prophet of Elohim, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. We have to proceed very speedly and very unorthodox to preach this gospel. 3. Our enemies are not sleeping at all, their Saboteurs, and all the traitors are not sleeping , therefore we shall not sleep either. 4. You must listen very very carefully, very very carefully . Listen to the voice of the founder of Bokoharam, Ali ndume. Is on video. 5. BBC had been against us during the war , it didnt start today. So what Facebook is doing is not new. 6. Every blessed day when we wake up, all we have to do is to remind them that we are unshakeable . 7. Politicians in nigeria , their job is to deceive people. It is their job to make sure you have no electricity, no good roads , no schools. 8. Nigerians also deceive themselves. They dont call for accountability, and that is why we call them a ZOO. 9. You cannot afford to be discouraged, our determination is unquestionable. 10. If you are wondering how evil a black man is , you must listen to what this man is saying , Ali ndume. 11. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down. That is why it is too easy for JANJAWEED to hold us down and kill us, to invade and to divide us at will. 12. Britain started this, as soon as they realised that we are children of God. 13. Another problem we have is igbo man love for gossip and back bite, it has to do with jealousy and enviness. 14. The reason why you will never hear about this Fulani invasion in any media is because they are all in their payroll. 12. This evening we are continuing our effort to unite Biafrans around the world, especially those in Biafraland. 13. When other people are grouping together you are busy gossiping, trying to divide each other . 14. This debate about Niger Delta is still raging. Saboteurs are hiding under the name niger delta to fight Biafra, to justify the deal they have entered into. 15. Biafrans are the most second hated people in the world. They see the blessing of God in you they hate you. 16. You cannot fight for Biafra unless you Unite the children of Elohim. 17. They think they can intimidate us, they think this is during the war when they media blockaded us while they were slaughtering us. Those days has gone. 18. Isn't it ironic , that children are now teaching the ""elders"" what they elders were supposed to be teaching us. 19. All we are doing is to shine the light and the people must choose where to follow. 20. Only an igbo man will deny that he never collected money when he has. 21. I want the whole world to know how an igbo man is behaving, self deceit and deception . This is why JANJAWEED are slaughtering us in our land. 22. So fools will ask , cant we make it igbo nations. Then I ask you, are you more igbo than an igbo in cross river ? Are you more igbo than igbo in igboakiri?. 23. That is why your politicians are useless, they cant defend you. 24. Why is it that Nnamdi Azikiwe and all your igbo leaders never borderd to unite you ? If not IPOB JANJAWEED will use you to make pepersoup. 25. Since 1940, Mazi Mbonu Ejike kept telling Azikiwe to drop one Nigeria and he refused and you want me to regard him as a great man. 26. What is it about Biafra that makes Britian to get ugly whenever you mention Biafra. 27. We are still going stronger than ever, and there Is no stopping us. 28. Nkpor massacre, do you know whom to be blame ? The Pig in the Creek, Asari Dokubo. 29. Everyday you gossip, all we need now is weapon to defend Biafraland. 30. Defense fund, Defense fund, and I say show me an igbo man that can bring out 100,000 USD to defend his land? 31. How many millionaires do you have in Biafraland, and yet none of them can bring out a cent to defend their land. 32. Nnamdi Azikiwe failed, and so called igbo leader has also failed, and they will continue to fail. 33. I told you that BBC is a fraud and I will proof it to you tonight . 34. I want Biafrans to know who their enemies are . 35. Gowon a Christian was chosen by the north to slaughter the Christians in Biafraland for them. 36. The only reason why the hated an igbo man is because of his success, everywhere they go , they survive . 37. I have nothing against Yoruba, I only hate traitors, the same wany i hate a traitor in igboland 38. The British organized Aburi conference, not because they want peace , but to have a reason to slaughter and orchestrate Genocide against our people. 39. On getting back to Lagos, on the instruction of the british including the Oba of Benin, because of their hatred for an igbo man the decline on Aburi. 40. I heard that someone invited Gowon to Biafraland to pray. So you are telling me that in Israel that somebody will invite Hitlers family to Israel. 41. So ask yourself, why will the British say no to Federalism, because British know that the FULANI'S (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/334528160425639/photos/a.434659417079179/677967409415044/?type=3,,,,,,,,52,1.86

An opening prayer said by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. If you have joined us this evening you should be able to listen to us via my facebook page. The most persecuted page, and they have now taken the same to my Twitter account. 3. I can announce to you this evening that we have a new family in the Seychelles. 4. I am the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Director of Radio Biafra. 5. We must now proceed to preach this gospel that Elohim tasked us to preach. 6. The only place on this planet earth where there is coal, gas and oil. The only place is Biafraland. 7. This evening, if you have any Biafran army in the ZOO army you better start looking for them, because the news we are getting is not favorable. 8. They are now selecting Biafran soldiers and transferring them to the North, Borono to be precisely. 9. They are killing our people as am addressing you tonight, if you have any Biafran soldiers in the ZOO army, better start looking for them now not tomorrow. 10. They were seen inside the barracks with our brothers sitting on the floor waiting to be transfered to Borono. 11. This evening we are placing the whole world on alart. If you have any relatives serving in the ZOO army, and you don't look for them now it will be too late by tomorrow. 12. I want the DSS to know tonight that there is nothing they are planning tonight that we are not privy to. 13. So before you put your heads to what you don't know, ask your friends in the army and police how far. 14. You people are terrorist in uniform, you want to help the JANJAWEED to conquer our land. 15. You want to come to Biafraland to abduct our coordinators, and i say come and abduct our people and see the stuff we are made of. 16. Before you will come and arrest and kill our people and we cry and you walk out free, now come and kill let God punish you all. 17. Any idiot that will come to Biafraland to kill, come and kill and you will die. 18. IT IS A DIRECT INSTRUCTION TO ALL VOLUNTEERS!!!! ANY FULANI YOU SEE, BOTH WITH THE VEHICLES THEY COME WITH MUST BE BURNT DOWN!!! ALLOW THEM TO COME IN AND THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE ROUTE !!!!! 19. AND THE DAY WE CATCH SABO!!! WE WILL SET AN EXAMPLE WITH YOU THAT THE WORLD WILL KNOW HOW SERIOUS WE ARE. 20. We know who your informants are, if we don't spare your masters be rest assured that we will not spare you. 21. So REFERENDUM is good for Scotland but not for Biafrans, because we are blacks and you are whites. Blacks are inferior to whites that's the thinking. 22. SS and Scotland yard are not there arresting and killing the people in Scotland, but you want to kill Biafrans for asking for their freedom. 23. Scotland Prime Minister Nicholas Sturge has promised to publish the legislature to guarantee Scotland independence next year. 24. But in your own case they said no, no independence for you. 25. I asked for Osinbajo they went and published someone dancing like Papa Ajasco😂😂. 26. This thing Scotland is debating in the open, is the same reason DSS is coming to Enugu to kill Biafrans and the British high commissioner is in Abiuja collecting her own share of Petrol dollar. 27. Why is it that there is a woman sitting in Abuja but Scotland is busy agitating for independence in her own country and she is in Abuja supervising the killings of Biafra. 28. Hypocrisy, if the highest order and that is what we are here to oppose and we must oppose it. 29. Before the white men came there was no place called Nigeria, only if you are an animal. 30. You know a black man has no shame, there is no dignity there is no honor. 31. Anybody who opens their stupid idiotic mouth to say they are niggarian, you are lower than an animal to me, you are fool and a completely idiot. 32. It is good for Scotland, but not good for a Nigerian. 33. They said that a British minister was surprised, they never sent the military and the airforce to go and bomb Scotland. 34. You will hear somebody come on channels TV and say go and bomb them they are miscreant, then I ask, is Nicolas Sturgeon also a miscreant? 35. Kosovo, Ukraine, Mecedonia all free, and all are in Europe, so only whites are allowed to be free, not blacks. 36. Britain, no fighter bomber to Scotland, they dialogued. But if is here in the ZOO, is pursue them and kill them, mad people. 37. Britain thought them how to kill Biafrans, as they killed our mothers and we never asked questions. 38. I want you to understand why Britain cannot talk, because they hate us they cannot stand us, and the same idiot gave us Anglican church. They gave us bible. 39. Always Britain killed us, they even otted the genocide that killed five million Biafrans. 40. That is why today Fulani is boasting for seven terrorist group. 41. That is why no Sabo will go free, instead one (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/Chibuking11/photos/a.1014284625435894/1388329358031417/?type=3,,,,,,,,52,1.62

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Tonight if your coming to listen to us, bring your pen and paper. If you are JANJAWEED, bring your chalk and slate. 3. Whenever i try to teach, I teach subjects that are incontrovertible. 4. We have the ability to reason on a continuous level . 5. Biafra is not like any other nation of the world and we make no apologies to that . 6. The greatest injustice anybody can do to you is to hide the truth from you. 7. What is happening today we foretold it, and we knew they will happen. 8. They so called men of God are afraid because they are not sure of what they are preaching. Instead all they are concerned about is tithes and Offerings. 9. I am saying this too because I am a Christian, controversial, but I will tell you why in short while, why all of us are Christians. 10. What am about to tell you this evening, no pastor knows the meaning of Christianity. Those that knows from Rome, hides it away from you. This night I will tell you. 11. People in Nigga area in Katsina went to do the same protest that you are doing around the world in the name of ""black lives matters"", the organizer of the same protest in Katsina Nastiwa Sharif, was arrested. 12. Amnesty international has reported that they have arrested this man because he is crying out about the killings of his people by bandits. 13. Not all advice from old people you should listen. Some old people grows old. 14. Nobody is more Christian than me. Listen attentively. The best place to start is ,who is a Christian?. According google, Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic teachings of Jesus christ. Meaning the religion teaching of one God. 15. What is the meaning of monotheism, ONE GOD. The same God that Judaism believes in. 16. During the time of Yeshua. The meaning of Yeshua is Chizoba, God saves. 17. The problem with the churches in Nigeria is that you steal money, and you kept quiet. You don't condemn the killings in Nigeria . 18. If not for Urigadari we wouldn't have had mobile phones today. The white people were superstitious like Africans we wouldn't have the mobile phones . 19. The name we bear is enough for me to know that God is real. I don't need a white man to teach me that. 20. My aim is to educate all these criminals, and fake people. 21. Do you actually know the meanig of Israel? It simply means the PRINCE OF GOD. 22. my aim is to educate and not to castigate anybody. Jesus prayed to ""my father in heaven"" so why don't you do what jesus have done? 23. What Europe has done over the years is wherever they go and see the children of light they will deny them their history. 24. Had the Israelites allowed themselves to be bamboozled, will there be israel today? 25. There is a place in Arochukwu called Ihechiowa, the place of light . 26. I told you that Biafra is the kingdom of God on earth. Everywhere they are answering light . How else do you need me to tell you that you are special. 27. And when I see all these blessed children of Biafra going to all these churches pastored by the former Moslems. 28. And then somebody is answering the name ""darkness"", nigga area and you want me to accept them? 29. Do you know why they hate us? because God said that darkness and light does not believe together. And you expect to be accepted by Nigeria which is a darkness? 30. Can you see why I have a problem with someone who answers Niger Delta. And someone wake up and call you darkness. 31. Lugard knows exactly what he was doing when he named you, ""the Great Biafra"" 32. Look at Sourh Africa, who made it beautiful? A white man. Immediately the whites handed over to black people they are backwards like other African countries. 33. You dont have sewage systems, we build a house we kept digging pits for toilets. 34. I want people to understand that we have proof for the migration of people from Israel. 35. The book of Zephaniah 3:10 says, after Ethipiopia you will see my people there. Look at the map, after Ethiopia is Biafara. 36. This is the book you carry everyday, the word of God and you go to those who does not know God to teach you the word of God. 37. The book of Zephaniah 3:10 , says from beyond Ethiopia, and after Ethiopia is the kingdom of Biafara the name of my village, Afara. 38. IPOB is light , the ZOO Nigga area is darkness. 39. Why I am upset with Yoruba is that they are Learned, they went to school, and yet they cannot reason. 40. Fulanis are busy impregnating 6 year olds in the North, these are the bastards you want to be with. 41. They are raping 6 year old children in Nigga area, and you said that you are a Nigerian? These are the people your daddy G.O wants you to be with. 42. Your real name is Nigerian, that's your real name. Funny enough that's a name that has been banned, but that is a name of a country in Africa.

Tonight we start by laying a background as we normally do. 4. Such an important and critical meeting you have been asking for ages , and now you finally got it and what did you do? you run quickly to Abuja, acting to be in control of IPOB, can you imagine such an utter garbage. 5. All of you who have been advising me to take it easy with Ohaneze, you tell me, what have we done to them now? 6. Somebody has even said that having a meeting with Ohaneze is like Aburi Accord, they will say one thing and do another thing. 7. I don't want people to say that we are stubborn and we don't listen, now we have given them the opportunity and have you seen where it led us? 8. They even said in their press release that IPOB should work hand in hand with Tony Nnadi one man band, onye ara bu file akpaghari. 9. This was the same thing they did when we had the JANJAWEED ebe di njo, and they have done it again. 10. So this has been their plan all along, so that they can show their masters that they are in control. 11. We must continue, we have to continue. 12. There was a Revolution now that happened in Abuja today, and you should have seen the convoy of military men and police and many people were arrested just for doing a protest. 13. The army said that they have no men to fight Bokoharam and protect families in Southern Kaduna, but you have more men, and more men to go and arrest protesters. 14. You've heard of violence protest going on around the world and none has been arrested. 15. The army left the war front, the army left Southern Kaduna to go and arrest those who are fighting for you for a better living. 16. Some of you forgot that communism collapsed in Soviet union because soldiers refused to shoot at the protesters. 17. Some of you, you wake up in the morning , you wear that your stupid army uniform, or civil defense uniform, you go out to arrest people who are fighting for freedom for the looters. 18. I don't know what is wrong with the HAUSA, the same mistakes you made in the past, you are repeating today. 19. Hausa I am asking you, does it mean you people enjoy being slaves? 20. Have you not seen the video of the national guard in America that were called out to stop protesters, and later joined the protesters? 21. Some of you fools cannot reason very well, if you are privileged with a bit of a common sense , you won't be going out there to arrest those fighting for your freedom. 22. Britain knows that Fulani owes Bokoharam and ISWAP, have they killed anyone? It appears that the more armed you are , the more you are feared and respected. 23. You are carrying a gun arresting someone who are fighting for good road , there is something wrong with a black man's head? 24. I keep asking a black man, don't you have shame? That a white man can come and build you a country. 25. You shouting one Nigeria, ask yourself this question, why is it that when FULANI'S are attacking when you call the army they won't respond? 26. They planned what they are doing many years ago, including the idiots that are going about arresting people and yet your villages are under siege, your mothers are being raped. 27. We are not fighting for marginalisation, we are fighting for freedom and we are not waiting for anyone. 28. Come and join IPOB, let's join hands and make Biafra another Japan. 29. Breaking News!!!!! ISIS and Al-Qaeda are planning to invade the South , and they will take it. What happened to Israel will happen to us, we will have to fight our way back in. 30. As some of you sabo are busy doing your work for the ZOO, some of you your mothers will be raped. 31. And I kept asking them, what are you doing in the ZOO army? 32. All if you idiots canvassing for igbo presidency, let me tell you, the history of your people they kill. you're here you run away to another place, they kept killing you and you are running around like a stomach upset. 33. Thunder will fire all of you fighting for new Nigeria gabarge, you will all will die a painful death. 34.

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR RADIO AND BAIFAR TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Baifran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35. Things are now happening in ZOO and I thank Chukwu Okike Abiama for that. 36. People that kept your name away from the people that suffered Genocide, are they going to love you ? 37. Ask yourself why did Britian swore that Biafra will not arise, they said over their dead bodies and that is why Britain will be divided. 38. I commend the Oduduwa agitators for coming out today to campaign in London. 39. In this era of Big brother, the indomie people forget so easily. 40.

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri. We are the descendants of Gad. Go to your history book and make your research. We (truncated)",,,,,,,,,47,-1.55

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA 1. An opening prayer in the language of heaven by the prophet of Elohim, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. We have to proceed very speedly and very unorthodox to preach this gospel. 3. Our enemies are not sleeping at all, their Saboteurs, and all the traitors are not sleeping , therefore we shall not sleep either. 4. You must listen very very carefully, very very carefully . Listen to the voice of the founder of Bokoharam, Ali ndume. Is on video. 5. BBC had been against us during the war , it didnt start today. So what Facebook is doing is not new. 6. Every blessed day when we wake up, all we have to do is to remind them that we are unshakeable . 7. Politicians in nigeria , their job is to deceive people. It is their job to make sure you have no electricity, no good roads , no schools. 8. Nigerians also deceive themselves. They dont call for accountability, and that is why we call them a ZOO. 9. You cannot afford to be discouraged, our determination is unquestionable. 10. If you are wondering how evil a black man is , you must listen to what this man is saying , Ali ndume. 11. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down. That is why it is too easy for JANJAWEED to hold us down and kill us, to invade and to divide us at will. 12. Britain started this, as soon as they realised that we are children of God. 13. Another problem we have is igbo man love for gossip and back bite, it has to do with jealousy and enviness. 14. The reason why you will never hear about this Fulani invasion in any media is because they are all in their payroll. 12. This evening we are continuing our effort to unite Biafrans around the world, especially those in Biafraland. 13. When other people are grouping together you are busy gossiping, trying to divide each other . 14. This debate about Niger Delta is still raging. Saboteurs are hiding under the name niger delta to fight Biafra, to justify the deal they have entered into. 15. Biafrans are the most second hated people in the world. They see the blessing of God in you they hate you. 16. You cannot fight for Biafra unless you Unite the children of Elohim. 17. They think they can intimidate us, they think this is during the war when they media blockaded us while they were slaughtering us. Those days has gone. 18. Isn't it ironic , that children are now teaching the ""elders"" what they elders were supposed to be teaching us. 19. All we are doing is to shine the light and the people must choose where to follow. 20. Only an igbo man will deny that he never collected money when he has. 21. I want the whole world to know how an igbo man is behaving, self deceit and deception . This is why JANJAWEED are slaughtering us in our land. 22. So fools will ask , cant we make it igbo nations. Then I ask you, are you more igbo than an igbo in cross river ? Are you more igbo than igbo in igboakiri?. 23. That is why your politicians are useless, they cant defend you. 24. Why is it that Nnamdi Azikiwe and all your igbo leaders never borderd to unite you ? If not IPOB JANJAWEED will use you to make pepersoup. 25. Since 1940, Mazi Mbonu Ejike kept telling Azikiwe to drop one Nigeria and he refused and you want me to regard him as a great man. 26. What is it about Biafra that makes Britian to get ugly whenever you mention Biafra. 27. We are still going stronger than ever, and there Is no stopping us. 28. Nkpor massacre, do you know whom to be blame ? The Pig in the Creek, Asari Dokubo. 29. Everyday you gossip, all we need now is weapon to defend Biafraland. 30. Defense fund, Defense fund, and I say show me an igbo man that can bring out 100,000 USD to defend his land? 31. How many millionaires do you have in Biafraland, and yet none of them can bring out a cent to defend their land. 32. Nnamdi Azikiwe failed, and so called igbo leader has also failed, and they will continue to fail. 33. I told you that BBC is a fraud and I will proof it to you tonight . 34. I want Biafrans to know who their enemies are . 35. Gowon a Christian was chosen by the north to slaughter the Christians in Biafraland for them. 36. The only reason why the hated an igbo man is because of his success, everywhere they go , they survive . 37. I have nothing against Yoruba, I only hate traitors, the same wany i hate a traitor in igboland 38. The British organized Aburi conference, not because they want peace , but to have a reason to slaughter and orchestrate Genocide against our people. 39. On getting back to Lagos, on the instruction of the british including the Oba of Benin, because of their hatred for an igbo man the decline on Aburi. 40. I heard that someone invited Gowon to Biafraland to pray. So you are telling me that in Israel that somebody will invite Hitlers family to Israel. 41.

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay. Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially. All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged. We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government. Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria. Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader. We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo. Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful. Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for. Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it. Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader. ~copied~",https://www.facebook.com/mmadubiafratv/photos/a.104482104609506/333282871729427/?type=3,,,Photos from Mmadu Biafra TV's post,,,,,44,-1.48

Yes in congo to be precise, there lived a man called ota benga around 1883. He was just starting up a family. So one day he returned from an elephant hunting to his village slaughtered, he was captured and sold into slavery. Ota benga lived at the American museum of natural history. As if that was not enough, he was transferred to an even more outrageous place which is the Bronx zoo. Reports gather that more than 500 white folks together with children laugh and jeer at Benga. They place a human being in a small cage.. This act of racism has been long. If I may ask why ? Are you from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa, Morocco or Mali? Are you from Ghana, Nigeria, Togo or liberia. Are you from Madagascar or you speak the sweet African Dialect of Swahili, Himba, Massai, Karo, Ethiopia, Wolof or Senegal? Inasmuch you are from this African continent only you have a complete human DNA. The first University in the world is here in Africa, the first overhead bridge was in Egypt, That is architecture began in Africa. Mathematics, Astronomy, Philosophy, Logic, Genetics and many more and don't be surprised Garden of Eden is here in Africa. The book of revelation said the spirit was bronze glowing before us. The color of bronze is Brown but here they still painted Jesus to be a white man, Tarzan is the king of the jungle in Africa but yet it's still a white. Everything painted white is good and everything painted black is evil.The richest man ever recorded was an African. Lanterns, aircombs, air conditioners were invented by africa. Medicine, mining and metallurgy. Cooking, calendars were invented by ancient egyptian over 500000 years ago and then the ways we divide our days into hours and minutes. Despite all the gifts we have we black's hate ourselves. A black man hates his fellow black man. A black man does not want his fellow black man to rule or progress. Some black men feel superior when they take pictures with a white man. They treat a white man like a god and treat their own fellow black man like a dog. Africa is richly blessed in both human and natural resources so I called on Africa's, Do you know according to research only you have a complete Human DNA so stop feeling inferior...🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Happy birthday to Nigeria @61yrs but no improvement because of corruption… Dennis Great... #celebritytourist #TheDc #onyenjem #dimmykiss",https://www.facebook.com/Authorify123/photos/a.103071791348001/391887725799738/?type=3,,,Photos from Dennis Corner's post,,,,,44,-1.41

(3) Our people are very easy to be very cheap and that is only when you tell them the truth, they will then come out in mass to support you - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (4) Any day i wake up and did not pray for you or did not think about restoring Biafra, if Chukwu Okike Abiama did not take my life away i will know that he is not God - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (5) When i was arrested in 2015, my people blocked the river Niger bridge for completely 4 days, i didn't pay them they did it because am telling them the truth and they love me for that, i will surely never disappoint them because Biafra must be restored - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (6) Some of you are angry because we lifted the boycott and you don't have PVC, but you do not know that those who do not collect their PVC are the best reason why they signed our document - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (7) We held the Zoo by the balls and they signed our document, who tell you that Chukwu Okike Abiama is not great? - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (8) When the terms and condition they signed is published i assure you many of them will commit suicide, i assure you that - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (9) The zoo said they will kill me if i evangelize but the only courage i have is whenever i look back, my people are always with me that is my only courage - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (10) Know this tonight that i am nothing without IPOB family, you made me who i am today and i promise i will never let you down - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (11) If you are in this hall tonight you are very lucky because you are going to experience another dimension of this very struggle and will be counted among those that restored Biafra - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (12) I am not God but a human being who can make a mistake, but please when you want to correct me do it with love and emotion not with envy and jealousy or hatred - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (13) Some people are disloyal to my deputy Uche Mefor and i chased them out of IPOB because i respect everyone and hate disloyalty - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (14) I told England to support Biafra or great calamity befall them and they will never be called United Kingdom again - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (15) When i was in the prison i curse Nigeria don't you know that? If Britain did not rise up and support Biafra God will punish them, they will suffer - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (16) Orji Uzor Kalu visited me when i was in Kuje prison and asked me to drop Biafra agitation and i ask him how do you intend to liberate our people? He suggested that IPOB should form a political party so that we can win presidency, then i ask him to bring someone that i will surely support him and he refused, then i ask him do you see how the Zoo called Nigeria have eaten you people the so called the Igbo elites? - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (17) Nigeria Kangoroo court/government want to do to me what they did to Uwazuruike, tell me when to eat, when to talk, when to go to bed and when to wake up just to ruin our agitation, but i refused and went for evangelism mad people everywhere in the Kangaroo Nigeria - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (18) Why we did not retaliate the operation Python Dance is because the Zoo wanted to know the type of weapons IPOB have so that they will start killing our people in the North but we are always ahead of them, i asked my people not to attack but today Zoo is collapsing - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. (19) I LIFTED THE ELECTION BOYCOTT FOR TWO THINGS (20) 1. If we had gone with the boycott our land would have been divided, because our people are republicans in nature, they would have said Nnamdi Kanu do not take advice. (21) 2. They would have attributed all violence that happened to IPOB - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu There are so many people working and contributing towards the Biafra restoration that i don't even know, may Elohim bless you all they shall be a great reward for you all and it won't take long time ~ Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.

A warning that came in the wake of the indiscriminate shootings and burning down of houses by the Nigerian soldiers in a small community located somewhere in Enugu State, which surfaced on the social media on the Monday 1st of November, 2021.

As it is not out of place to think that in this 21st century, the Nigerian military ought to have evolved into a modern, refined and humane institution primed to join the league of exemplary militaries across the world in the true service of humanity. But we could not have been more wrong and presumptuous of a military stubbornly stuck up in ancient times, that continues to show itself only as a barbaric force set out to maim and kill the very people it is supposed to protect. This institution has deteriorated into a worse condition than it was, prior to the government of Muhammadu Buhari. The image of that day says it all. It speaks to the peculiar character of a military drunk with hate, coupled with an uninhibited power and authority to showcase its object of hate as it so chooses.

At present, both the military and the government are indoors plotting more military operations that will soon sweep through a broad swath of Igboland. But then again, the necessary question to ask the Nigerian government and the military generals is, what more operations are you expecting your soldiers to carry out? Let me guess: they are to embark on operations in small towns, villages, marketplaces or inside family homes in Igboland where harmless children and old people are likely to be found playing or going about their businesses. Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people.

Even though I know they can't do anything. I did not in any way hate Christianity or am I fighting against Christianity. Anyone seeing it as such should tell me of I am not a Christian myself. I am simply saying that anyone in IPOB championing a one week One Nigeria Christian sit at home is a distraction to us. As far as Nigeria is concerned, no protest done under the umbrella of Christianity will work. It is only but a fruitless venture. If you want to get yourself unnecessarily busy, I will understand, but for you to be seriously thinking you will use Christianity to give the zoo a fight, then you are a joker. The only way you can use it is the expose the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria. But these same Christians are so fragmented that they can't put up one front. How do you detache these people from their pastors? How do you make catholics to come together with Anglican? How do you make Adebayo to stand in solidarity with a jet pastor against the government? Some of these men are mega pastors that feed fat on the corruption ravaging Nigeria. Some of these men of God do nothing other than launder money for these politicians. You think they will just watch and see you destroy their empire? You think so? They are the men that always come to give vision that Nigeria won't divide, whenever the people pushes harder. Give them money and they will dismiss their own people with one fake prophecy. You are already a failure when you fight this evil under Christianity. You are Christians, yet tribes and interest is still holding us all down. Nothing you do under One Nigeria will work. Let people rise as a people. When Fulanii herdsmen attacks a community, they don't ask if you are a Christian or not. They attack a people. They will ki""ll both traditionalists and atheists alike. No one is safe. If you keep pushing for one Nigeria Christian sit at home, then you are now fighting a Nigeria fight. You are uniting Nigeria and working indirectly for One Nigeria. If Middle Belt must rise up, they must rise up as a people and not as Christians. We rose up as Biafrans, and not as Christians, Jews, traditionalists or atheists. Oduduwa people rose up as a people and not as Christians or Muslims. When you push for Christians in Nigeria, you are setting us Backwards. I have said enough. But let me say it again that there will never be any Christian sit at home and even if you secure a date, it will be a resounding failure. One Nigeria don't have what it takes to do that. We should not in any way waste our time campaigning for what won't happen. Tell middle belt that we have already an ongoing protest against the jihadist, let them join the Monday voluntary Sit at home. We can't suspend anything to champion or carry their matter for head. Or if they can't join, they should at least give us a date for the sit at home they called for. They already know we are ever ready. So the ball is on their call. Avoid distraction. Do not start a One Nigeria Christian struggle. You are reinvigorating Nigeria with it. That name is a curse. It doesn't exist. It should be killed.

Mazi Nnamdi Kanu made several consecutive and remarkable points during this mother broadcast. He said that he has two mission on Earth which includes; restoration of Biafra and the destruction of Nigeria.

Below are some other interesting keywords:

""I will continue to stream and there is nothing Facebook can do about it. If the Yoruba people working for Facebook like, let them cut me off and I will take them to court in the United States, not in the ZOO"".

""I have two jobs assigned to me by Elohim. One is to restore Biafra, and the last one is to ensure that the name Nigeria no longer exists. When I am talking write it down. This is why I always ask you to come with your pen and paper"".

""O'kwanu eligwe zie mu ozi m'zie ndi di ndu, (heaven gives me a message and I give to the living). The more they talk about us the more they promote us. Everywhere you go the words in the lips of everyone are IPOB and Nnamdi Kanu, and I love it"".

""All of you are not offended to go to Europe that killed you in millions, but you are offended of being insulted by Nnamdi Kanu"".

""Why do we expose the Ohaneze ndi oshi na ndi ara na ndi ama. I am going to tell you the reason why we are harsh on them and speak the way we do. After listening this night you will stone them"".

""Can you imagine the number of illegitimate children we have in Biafraland after fighting a war, these are the people and the idiots you see on social media.

""Gowon said, if I knew that Igbo loved money so much I wouldn't have gone to war, I would have shared money to them to fight each other. And that is what they are doing now.

""After being arrested and imprisoned unjustly, I came out and I told them that they are going to rape and kill your wives and children.

""If they say to you when we are growing up, that somebody will come to your village and pick your daughter and nobody will say anything, would you have believed it?

""You are there claiming that you are elder, and somebody traveled from Mali, came to your village and knocked on the door, and picked up your daughter, and you come up on Facebook and talk nonsense. You people have no shame.

""I have been talking to you people from 2013 till 2017 and you people did not listen. Have you not seen the mess Yorubaland Is in, do you people think that you will bring Biafra to that level? Don't you people know who we are?

""In Uli Anambra, a girl was cut into pieces, and people are making mouth, I have money, where is the Governor? Where is Willie Obiano? I don't know what voice to use so that you people will understand the mess you are in, because you people have no shame.

""And you are walking about your business as if nothing happened because it's not your daughter that is butchered. Do you see why I speak to you the way I do because you have no empathy, you are heartless and not human.

""And some satanic individuals will go about writing rubbish that it is farmers and herders clash. Darkness has taken over in our land, that men will see evil and condone it, and you expected me to be nice to you.

""They went around Biafraland promising all the Governors Vice President position, one single position to everybody, and what is the catch, by giving our land to Fulani.

""Are you listening to what Obiano said. If you go to Anambra State now and kill a man all you have to pay is 500,000 naira. As part of the deal for the rigging of his election, Obiano went and brought in Myetti Allah as part of his government. Every police station is under instruction to offer strategic support to killer Fulani as they match down South.

""Nnamdi Kanu is insultive, while your daughters are being taken right before your eyes, which one is more insultive? Your daughters are being abducted, raped and cut into pieces and you are not ashamed. Look at the woman who was abducted, did the village vigilante do anything, the answer is NO!!

""The people invading you are well organized, they have over 30 billion stashed away, and you have nothing. And you are telling people, our people, go to your village and organize your vigilante, and am asking you, how can your village wage war against a Platinum of Fulani?

""They are now coming out to tell the Yoruba that Kwara was conquered by the Fulani, the Magaji of Ilorin. Yoruba has never been able to convince themselves in their brain that they need freedom. In Yorubaland, they are looking for political control of freedom.

""I can not hate anybody, we speak the way we do so that you can change.

""Afenifere never allowed Fulani to plant Saboteurs in their apex forum, unlike the PANDEF and Ohaneze, and I give them credit for that.

""It was Edwin Clark who was a traitor and Arch Saboteur who single-handedly sabotaged Biafra.

Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people.

Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem. Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.” He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then. He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote. But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari! Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines. This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t know of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari. Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",https://www.facebook.com/TheNoisemakerng/photos/a.438373356705050/966498860559161/?type=3,,,,,,,,39,-1.31

An opening prayer by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, and in the same vein, the director of both Radio and Biafra television. 2. I will continue to stream and there is nothing Facebook can do about it. If the Yoruba people working for Facebook like, let them cut me off and I will take them to court in the United States not in the ZOO. 3. I have two jobs assigned to me by Elohim. One is to restore Biafra, and the last one is to ensure that the name Nigeria does no longer exist. When am talking write it down. 4. This is why I always ask you to come with your pen and paper 5. O'kwanu eligwe zie mu ozi m'zie ndi di ndu, (heaven gives me message and I give to the living) 6. The more they talk about us the the promote us. Everywhere you go the words in the lips of everyone is IPOB and Nnamdi Kanu, and I love it. 7. All of you are not offended to go to Europe that killed you in millions, but you are offended of being insulted by Nnamdi Kanu. 8. Why do we expose the Ohaneze ndi oshi na ndi ara na ndi ama. I am going to tell you the reason why we are harsh on them and speak the way we do. 9. After listening this night you will stone them. 10. Can you imagine the number of illegitimate children we have in Biafraland after fighting a war, these are the people and the idiots you see on social media. 11. Gowon said , if I knew that Igbo loved money so much i wouldn't have gone to war, i would have shared money to them to fight each other. And that is what they are doing now. 12. After going to the ZOO and went to jail , when I came out I told them that they are going to rape and kill your wives and children. 13. If they say to you when we are growing up, that somebody will come to your village and pick your daughter and nobody will say anything, would you have believed it? 14. You are there claiming that you are elder, and somebody travelled from Mali and came to your village and knock on the door , and pick up your daughter, and you come up on Facebook and talk nonsense. You people have no shame. 15. I have been talking to you people since 2013 till 2017 and you people did not listen. 16. Have you not seen the mess Yorubaland Is in, do you people think that you will bring Biafra to that level? Don't you people know whom we are? 17. In Uli Anambra a girl was cut into pieces, and people are making mouth , I have money, where is the Governor? Where is Willie Obiano? 18. I don't know what voice to use so that you people will understand the mess you are in, because you people have no shame. 19. And you are walking about your business as if nothing happened because is not your daughter that is butchered. Do you see why I speak to you the way I do, because you have no empathy. you are heartless and not human. 20. And some satanic individuals will go about writring rubbish that it is farmers and herders clash. 21. Darkness has taken over in our land, that men will see evil and condone it, and you expected to be nice to you. 22. They went around Biafraland promising all the Governors Vice President position, one single position to everybody, and what is the catch, by giving our land to Fulani. 23. Are you listening what Obiano said. If you go to Anambra State now and kill a man all you have to pay is 500,000 naira. 24. As part of the deal for the rigging of his election, Obiano went and brought in Myetti Allah as part of his government. 25. Every police station are under instruction to offer strategic support to killer Fulani as the Match down South. 26. Nnamdi Kanu is insultive, while your daughters are being taken right before your eyes , which one is more insultive? 27. Your daughters are being abducted, raped and cut into pieces and you are not ashamed. 28. Look at the woman who was abducted, did the village vigilante do anything, the answer is NO!! 29. The people invading you are well organized, they have over 30 billion stashed away, and you have nothing . 30. And you are telling people, our people , go to your village and organize your vigilante, and am asking you, how can your village wage war against a Platinum of Fulani? 31. They are now coming out to tell the Yoruba that Kwara was conquered by the Fulani, the Magaji of Ilorin. 32. Yoruba has never been able to convince themselves in their brain that they need freedom. In Yorubaland they are looking for political control of freedom. 33. I can not hate anybody, we speak the way we do so that you can change . 34. Afenifere never allowed Fulani to plant Saboteurs in their apex forum, unlike the PANDEF and Ohaneze, and I give them credit for that. 35. It was Edwin Clark who was a traitor and Arch Saboteur who single handedly stabotaged Biafra. 36. Unless you mention Nnamdi Kanu or IPOB, nobody will read what you are writing.

I will start this evening by dicepting the STUPIDITY! Of an igbo man. #We got to where we are today bcs of the complesence of an igbo. #You listened to the Janjaweed and they have given you a new identity. #Those who are close to Obiano must advice him, that it's better for all the Governors on our land to work together. #Those barriers must come down, to allow people to mingle and travel around. #I can see the effort Professor Ejiofor is making in America , but it appears to be a losing battle. Very sad indeed. #Every Prophet said it , about the impending danger in our land. But yet we did nothing. #Ground mothers are listening, how do I do this now .. #Had we not rushed back to the north after the war. Due to selfishness and individualism of an igbo man. #I expected them after the war to go into costal Region to mend fences but they didnt do it, until I started that effort. #We are not a people that learnt from history. Since 1945 the ve been killing us and yet we have not learnt. #The only thing that has been shielding us is the mercy of Elohim. If it was left for the effort of an igbo man, we would have been a conquered people by now.. #I saw what Obianno was doing today, I felt ashamed of myself. #Gi wuru okenye iberibe nobody will respect you. #Obianno doesnt know the history of Headbridge, that's why he is closing the bridge. #There is a place in Igweocha called umuada olu.

I give you only 2years you generation will be forgotten. #None of you in America will ask, why was headbridge closed. #People are nothing cooperating, that's why only 5000 men took over Africa. #Nzeowgu, Ironsi, and Azikiwe, they were all born in the north, and fourth for one Nigeria. #We had a whole year to plan the war, until the war came, we start ranning around, 5m lay dead. Same thing is happening now. #A white man had shame , honour and dignity. Something a black man dont have. #I came to America recently asking you to contribute just $1, did you? igbo man full of jelousey and envy, now they have come. #Some of you dont realise why Elohim sent you to America , so you can save your people. Some of you dont know. #Every blessed day , Fulani shows you how much they hate you. What we will do to some of you in America when Biafra come.. #Awusa abatago awka, and idiots are busy talking about true Federalism.. #There is another idiot using a registered business to buy land and sell to Fulani. #Hope OZODINGBA is giving our land to Fulani for Alamajiri schools. #Fulani despices you bcs Nzeogwu killed the Saudana of Sokoto, Amadu Bello, Shot the idiot dead. #Elohim please give us Biafra, so we can teach those idiots in America lessons. #It is a collective effort, we must come together and defend our land. #Do you want me to beg you, so you can defend your land? Are you not foolish? #This week we remeber those who sacrificed their life that we might live. #People dont know that Biafra is our Religion. The more you kill us, the more we intensify. #In that $1 account do you know how much is there? $37,000. You know me i dont hide anything... #The British and U.S high commissioner , their bag is full of bribe. #We are on our own. America will only belive their Ambassador over us. #You must understand that they have started the killings. #This is for those of you from Owrrri in the U.S, they have started detonating bombs in Owerri as a trial. #That was how we sold our people to Arab first, then white people. That's how God coursed Africa. #America after the war gave money for the rebuilding of Germany. That's why God love the white man. #You people dont know what is happening in Kaduna. Christians is Southern Kaduna are finished. #Go to Ukwa, our land is gone.

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business. That is the ZOO for you. 39. The reason why what is happening about SARS is resonating 40.

For those of you who have been dancing to the rhythms of the drums of war being continuously beaten by the PDP, Nnamdi Kanu and his IPOB rats, CAN, NCEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Femi Fani-Kayode, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Gani Adam's, Afenifere, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF, etc. I hope the corona virus pandemic and the accompanying lockdown has given you a very faint idea of what a war situation would be like. Just under seven weeks of a lockdown, and you are already screaming of hunger and begging for palliatives from Buhari. Let me assure you that whatever hardships or inconvenience you think you are suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer if war ever breaks out as a result of the ""Biafra or death"", ""Islamization"", ""Fulani jihad"", ""Fulanization"", and ""Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria"" propaganda churned out by Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF etc, and your spiritual Papas and Daddy G.Os. They have been beating the drums of propaganda and war with a very big stick, and you have been dancing furious steps to the rhythms. They tell you that Buhari wants to Islamize Nigeria, and you cheer. They say Buhari is the one arming and sending Fulani herdsmen to kill you, and you scream delightedly. They say Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria, and you believe them. They say Buhari wants to kill every Southerner along with those in the Middle-Belt, and give the vacant land to his Fulani kinsmen, and you agree. They incite the Igbos against other Nigerians, and you rejoice. They incite Christians against Muslims, and you dance for joy. They abuse Northerners and Muslims and Fulanis and the Yorubas, and you celebrate. You call Fulanis and Northerners cows. You call Nigeria a zoo and other Nigerians animals in the zoo. They tell you to get ready to fight a war and defend yourselves and your land against the Sokoto Caliphate and the sons of Usman Dan Fodio, and you scream in excitement. They call the Fulanis bloodthirsty demons from Futa Jallon, and you are giddy with delight. This is the rubbish that the PDP, CAN, NCEF, your Pastors and Daddy G.Os, Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Reno Omokri, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle-Belt forum, South-South Leaders Forum, PANDEF, etc, have been feeding you with for ages, and you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker, instead of using your braino like rational beings. They have politicised religion and weaponised it as a tool of political blackmail. They have been playing the religious card in a very dangerous and reckless manner since 2014, viciously fanning the smouldering embers of ethno-tribal and religious divisions and hatred. I want to announce to you that if and when the conflagration ignites, whatever you think you're suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer in a war situation. You are screaming for palliatives now, but nobody will give you palliatives in a war situation. I heard that in some parts of the Country, the prices of foodstuffs have risen astronomically. For example, a paint bucket of garri is now selling at N1800 in some parts of the country. The cost of satchets and bags of ""Pure Water"" have doubled. In a war situation, you will buy a paint bucket of garri for N10,000 or more, i.e if you could even see it to buy. Let me not talk about the other staples like yam, beans, rice, cassava, etc. A wrap of ""Akpu"" may cost as much as N1000. You will buy a loaf of bread for N7000, assuming it is even available. You have been shouting ""hunger"" and "" hardship"" since Buhari came to power, but in a war situation, you will know what ""hunger"" and ""hardship"" is. Then you will realize that what you are currently experiencing is Paradise in comparison. You are complaining that you are tired of staying at home because of the lockdown. In a war situation, you will most likely not even have a home to stay in; you will be too busy running for your life or hiding in the bush or the forest, or living in a refugee camp. You are complaining that health facilities are poor; in a war situation, there will be no hospitals to go to, because many of them will be bombed or razed to the ground, and the few available ones will be overflowing with war casualties. Believe you me, those your Daddy G.Os and Spiritual Papas will hop on their private jets and fly out of the Country if and when those embers of ethno-tribal and religious hate they have been fanning ignite, and leave you to face the music. Those Ohanaeze and Afenifere and Middle-Belt Forum and South-South Leaders Forum and PANDEF politicians will race to the nearest Foreign Embassy building and hide themselves there, and leave you to roast in the fire.

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper ready, if you don't get your pen and paper ready, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they choose to believe the Lies 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business and not a country, is a mere British business. That is the ZOO for you. 39. The reason why what is happening about SARS is resonating 40.

I will start this evening by dicepting the STUPIDITY! Of an igbo man. #We got to where we are today bcs of the complesence of an igbo. #You listened to the Janjaweed and they have given you a new identity. #Those who are close to Obiano must advice him, that it's better for all the Governors on our land to work together. #Those barriers must come down, to allow people to mingle and travel around. #I can see the effort Professor Ejiofor is making in America , but it appears to be a losing battle. Very sad indeed. #Every Prophet said it , about the impending danger in our land. But yet we did nothing. #Ground mothers are listening, how do I do this now .. #Had we not rushed back to the north after the war. Due to selfishness and individualism of an igbo man. #I expected them after the war to go into costal Region to mend fences but they didnt do it, until I started that effort. #We are not a people that learnt from history. Since 1945 the ve been killing us and yet we have not learnt. #The only thing that has been shielding us is the mercy of Elohim. If it was left for the effort of an igbo man, we would have been a conquered people by now.. #I saw what Obianno was doing today, I felt ashamed of myself. #Gi wuru okenye iberibe nobody will respect you. #Obianno doesnt know the history of Headbridge, that's why he is closing the bridge. #There is a place in Igweocha called umuada olu.

Are you not foolish? #This week we remeber those who sacrificed their life that we might live. #People dont know that Biafra is our Religion. The more you kill us, the more we intensify. #In that $1 account do you know how much is there? $37,000. You know me i dont hide anything... #The British and U.S high commissioner , their bag is full of bribe. #We are on our own. America will only belive their Ambassador over us. #You must understand that they have started the killings. #This is for those of you from Owrrri in the U.S, they have started detonating bombs in Owerri as a trial. #That was how we sold our people to Arab first, then white people. That's how God coursed Africa. #America after the war gave money for the rebuilding of Germany. That's why God love the white man. #You people dont know what is happening in Kaduna.

SHABBATH SHALOM GREAT BIAFRANS!
KING JAMES VERSION (KJV).
Psalms 139:1-24(BIAFRA WAY)  
1. O LORD, thou hast searched me, Nnamdi Kanu, and known me.
2. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
3. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
5. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
8. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea (in Great Britain);
10. Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me (in Kenya); even the night shall be light about me.
12. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
15. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
16. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
19. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked (saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies), O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
21. Do not I hate them (Nigeria), O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
Iseeee iseeee iseeee.

Let us pray.
We thank Thee Oh God our Father for your immeasurable love towards us. We will forever worship and adore Thee because there is none like Thee. From everlasting to everlasting You remaineth the same.
We thank Thee for your servant and our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who You created for the purpose of restoration of Biafra and put in him a different Spirit that no man can lure him to disobey your instructions and commandments.
We thank You Lord because nothing happens to him and your people Biafrans without your knowledge.
Who will say and it comes to pass when you have not given approval? For only your counsel concerning Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans shall stand.
Hence the conspiracies of Saboteurs, Fulanis, Kenya, Britain and allies are broken in pieces and can never stand. 
Therefore any one who has a hand in the illegally abduction of Nnamdi Kanu is used to fulfill your purpose and will die as Judas Iscariot. They will all be brought into thy judgement seat and will never escape death, for their iniquity is full.
Our Father and our God Chukwu Okike Abiama, we know that your ways are different from man's ways and your thoughts are higher than ours, therefore we trust in Thee to deliver our leader and Biafra Nation your own way.
Daniel never knew that lions would not eat him up, he resigned to death, but Thou delivered him by the same king who threw him there.
Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego didn't know that the fire would not consume them; but Thou sent your son into the fire to prevent the same fire that burned up those who threw them there from hurting them.
We can go on and on to recount thy wonderous works and we are sure that You will fulfill your promise to your servant Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans.
The Zoo and Britain do not have what it takes to jail or kill your servant because you have the final say.
We are waiting patiently Oh Lord for our leader to rejoin us and together we will sing and praise Thee in Biafra Nation as he said.
We commit the ESN, DOS, Legal team, Media warriors, various departments of IPOB family, those who are still incarcerated in various prisons and all genuine Biafrans into Your hands, to uphold us till (truncated)",,,,36,-4.33

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25. I do not need to be diplomatic when am (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/2096389610621625/photos/a.2123855497875036/2421561514771098/?type=3,,,,,,,,35,-1.37

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I dont belive in the ZOO called nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he has I LOVE JESUS AND IM PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. I.G.B.O is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable , the igbo is a very very stubborn race , to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us Previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger , and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested , the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as thr so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previ to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers , but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother , how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm , please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do ? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed , that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school , did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even come onto the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36.

This my presentation is for our enemies who often state that Igbos are hated worldwide because Igbos are all criminals.

Dr PIUS OKIGBO: He was the first black professor of Economics at the university of London in 1954. 10. CHIKE TONI IWOBI: He is the first and only black African to be made a senator in Italy. 11. JOHN ABRAHAM GODSON (Godson Chikama Onyekwere): He is the first and only black African to be made a senator in Poland. He was born in 1970 at Umuahia in Abia state. He graduated from Abia State University. 12. KANU NWANKWO: Needs no introduction. I schooled with him at Holy Ghost College, Owerri in the 80s. He is an Arochukwu (Abia state) man. Kanu is the most decorated African footballer, winning every possible medal apart from the senior world cup. He made his fortune at Ajax in Netherlands, Inter Milan in Italy, Arsenal, West Bromwich Albion and Portsmouth, all in England, UK. 13. PHILIP EMEAGWALI: He is the first and only black African to win the Gordon Bell Prize. He achieved this in 1989. He was congratulated and praised by President Bill Clinton of the USA. He is regarded as one of the top 10 most intelligent persons on earth at the moment. He has moved almost all his village members to the USA. He does not wish to be associated with Nigeria. He considers himself BIAFRAN. 14. Five Anambra state girls from Regina Pacies secondary school, Onitsha, Anambra state represented Nigeria and Africa and won Gold (First position) at the World Technovation Challenge in the Silicon Valley in San Francisco, USA. Note that European countries, the USA, India and China participated in the contest. The names of the girls are Jessica Osita, Promise Nnalue, Nwabuaku Ossai, Adaeze Onuigbo and Vivian Okoye. 15.

The boys are Ugwuish Ogonna, Chuka-Umeora, Anthony Nwachukwu and Daniel Machi Dominic. 16. NNENNE IWUJI-EME is a British diplomat. In March 2018, she was appointed to be the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Mozambique. She is the first black woman to be appointed a high commissioner by the United Kingdom. She is Igbo. 17. Dr Bennet IFEAKANDU OMALU born September 1968 in Anambra is an Igbo-American physician, forensic pathologist, and neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in American football players. The list goes on and on. IN SUMMARY: The International community loves the Igbo. The International community respects the Igbo. The International community rewards excellence and hardwork (unlike the zoo). Only Nigerians hate Igbo-Biafrans and we know why. Unfortunately for the haters, the more they hate Igbos the higher the Igbos climb. So advise them to stop hating. You hate something yet can't let it go. https://therepublicannews.net",https://www.facebook.com/therepublicannews/photos/a.1920027191573616/2630212693888392/?type=3,,,,,,,,35,-1.17

Biafra is not like any other nation of the world and we make no apologies to that . 6. The greatest injustice anybody can do to you is to hide the truth from you. 7. What is happening today we foretold it, and we knew they will happen. 8. They so called men of God are afraid because they are not sure of what they are preaching. Instead all they are concerned about is tithes and Offerings. 9. I am saying this too because I am a Christian, controversial, but I will tell you why in short while, why all of us are Christians. 10. What am about to tell you this evening, no pastor knows the meaning of Christianity. Those that knows from Rome, hides it away from you. This night I will tell you. 11. People in Nigga area in Katsina went to do the same protest that you are doing around the world in the name of ""black lives matters"", the organizer of the same protest in Katsina Nastiwa Sharif, was arrested. 12. Amnesty international has reported that they have arrested this man because he is crying out about the killings of his people by bandits. 13. Not all advice from old people you should listen. Some old people grows old. 14. Nobody is more Christian than me. Listen attentively. The best place to start is ,who is a Christian?. According google, Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic teachings of Jesus christ. Meaning the religion teaching of one God. 15. What is the meaning of monotheism, ONE GOD. The same God that Judaism believes in. 16. During the time of Yeshua. The meaning of Yeshua is Chizoba, God saves. 17. The problem with the churches in Nigeria is that you steal money, and you kept quiet. You don't condemn the killings in Nigeria . 18. If not for Urigadari we wouldn't have had mobile phones today. The white people were superstitious like Africans we wouldn't have the mobile phones . 19. The name we bear is enough for me to know that God is real. I don't need a white man to teach me that. 20. My aim is to educate all these criminals, and fake people. 21. Do you actually know the meanig of Israel? It simply means the PRINCE OF GOD. 22. my aim is to educate and not to castigate anybody. Jesus prayed to ""my father in heaven"" so why don't you do what jesus have done? 23.

Had the Israelites allowed themselves to be bamboozled, will there be israel today? 25. There is a place in Arochukwu called Ihechiowa, the place of light . 26. I told you that Biafra is the kingdom of God on earth. Everywhere they are answering light . How else do you need me to tell you that you are special. 27. And when I see all these blessed children of Biafra going to all these churches pastored by the former Moslems. 28. And then somebody is answering the name ""darkness"", nigga area and you want me to accept them? 29. Do you know why they hate us? because God said that darkness and light does not believe together.

We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25. I do not need to be diplomatic when am telling you the truth.

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR RADIO AND BAIFAR TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Baifran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35. Things are now happening in ZOO and I thank Chukwu Okike Abiama for that. 36. People that kept your name away from the people that suffered Genocide, are they going to love you ? 37. Ask yourself why did Britian swore that Biafra will not arise, they said over their dead bodies and that is why Britain will be divided. 38. I commend the Oduduwa agitators for coming out today to campaign in London. 39. In this era of Big brother, the indomie people forget so easily. 40.

An opening prayer said by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. If you have joined us this evening you should be able to listen to us via my facebook page. The most persecuted page, and they have now taken the same to my Twitter account. 3. I can announce to you this evening that we have a new family in the Seychelles. 4. I am the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Director of Radio Biafra. 5. We must now proceed to preach this gospel that Elohim tasked us to preach. 6. The only place on this planet earth where there is coal, gas and oil. The only place is Biafraland. 7. This evening, if you have any Biafran army in the ZOO army you better start looking for them, because the news we are getting is not favorable. 8. They are now selecting Biafran soldiers and transferring them to the North, Borono to be precisely. 9. They are killing our people as am addressing you tonight, if you have any Biafran soldiers in the ZOO army, better start looking for them now not tomorrow. 10. They were seen inside the barracks with our brothers sitting on the floor waiting to be transfered to Borono. 11. This evening we are placing the whole world on alart. If you have any relatives serving in the ZOO army, and you don't look for them now it will be too late by tomorrow. 12. I want the DSS to know tonight that there is nothing they are planning tonight that we are not privy to. 13. So before you put your heads to what you don't know, ask your friends in the army and police how far. 14. You people are terrorist in uniform, you want to help the JANJAWEED to conquer our land. 15. You want to come to Biafraland to abduct our coordinators, and i say come and abduct our people and see the stuff we are made of. 16. Before you will come and arrest and kill our people and we cry and you walk out free, now come and kill let God punish you all. 17. Any idiot that will come to Biafraland to kill, come and kill and you will die. 18. IT IS A DIRECT INSTRUCTION TO ALL VOLUNTEERS!!!! ANY FULANI YOU SEE, BOTH WITH THE VEHICLES THEY COME WITH MUST BE BURNT DOWN!!! ALLOW THEM TO COME IN AND THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE ROUTE !!!!! 19. AND THE DAY WE CATCH SABO!!! WE WILL SET AN EXAMPLE WITH YOU THAT THE WORLD WILL KNOW HOW SERIOUS WE ARE. 20. We know who your informants are, if we don't spare your masters be rest assured that we will not spare you. 21. So REFERENDUM is good for Scotland but not for Biafrans, because we are blacks and you are whites. Blacks are inferior to whites that's the thinking. 22. SS and Scotland yard are not there arresting and killing the people in Scotland, but you want to kill Biafrans for asking for their freedom. 23. Scotland Prime Minister Nicholas Sturge has promised to publish the legislature to guarantee Scotland independence next year. 24. But in your own case they said no, no independence for you. 25. I asked for Osinbajo they went and published someone dancing like Papa Ajasco😂😂. 26. This thing Scotland is debating in the open, is the same reason DSS is coming to Enugu to kill Biafrans and the British high commissioner is in Abiuja collecting her own share of Petrol dollar. 27. Why is it that there is a woman sitting in Abuja but Scotland is busy agitating for independence in her own country and she is in Abuja supervising the killings of Biafra. 28. Hypocrisy, if the highest order and that is what we are here to oppose and we must oppose it. 29. Before the white men came there was no place called Nigeria, only if you are an animal. 30. You know a black man has no shame, there is no dignity there is no honor. 31. Anybody who opens their stupid idiotic mouth to say they are niggarian, you are lower than an animal to me, you are fool and a completely idiot. 32.

You will hear somebody come on channels TV and say go and bomb them they are miscreant, then I ask, is Nicolas Sturgeon also a miscreant? 35. Kosovo, Ukraine, Mecedonia all free, and all are in Europe, so only whites are allowed to be free, not blacks. 36. Britain, no fighter bomber to Scotland, they dialogued.

I want you to understand why Britain cannot talk, because they hate us they cannot stand us, and the same idiot gave us Anglican church. They gave us bible. 39.

A warning that came in the wake of the indiscriminate shootings and burning down of houses by the Nigerian soldiers in a small community located somewhere in Enugu State, which surfaced on the social media on the Monday 1st of November, 2021. By every indication, the video was recorded by one of the soldiers, either as a revolt against what was being done by fellow soldiers or simply, out of sheer impudence to commit such heinous crimes and still go scot-free. But whatever be the case, the crucial factor here is that the beastly crime those soldiers committed on that day, is out there for all to see. And it is only one of many such atrocities. The point has to be made about this incident so that we do not easily forget the horror that played out that day and also to give ourselves more time to digest the facts about the vampiric mortals adorning the uniforms of the Nigerian military. As it is not out of place to think that in this 21st century, the Nigerian military ought to have evolved into a modern, refined and humane institution primed to join the league of exemplary militaries across the world in the true service of humanity. But we could not have been more wrong and presumptuous of a military stubbornly stuck up in ancient times, that continues to show itself only as a barbaric force set out to maim and kill the very people it is supposed to protect. This institution has deteriorated into a worse condition than it was, prior to the government of Muhammadu Buhari. The image of that day says it all. It speaks to the peculiar character of a military drunk with hate, coupled with an uninhibited power and authority to showcase its object of hate as it so chooses. In many ways, the characters looked far more deadlier than the weapons in their hands. A murderous set of soldiers, lethal and unforgiving by any description, firing away indiscriminately at any living thing and with relative ease and enjoyment. And in plain sight, was what seemed an infinite rage of anti-Igbo coloration, as if they were on a mission to fulfill an age-old prophetic mandate of apocalyptic retaliation. Be that as it may, this could not have been glossed over or swept under the rug anywhere else but in Nigeria. And going by the entrenched culture of impunity among the Nigerian politicians and members of the armed forces, none of these murderous soldiers or their commanders is likely to be held accountable or at least, queried by the Nigerian authorities. Which tells a very macabre yet, the true story of Nigeria; a country steeped in political and economic cannibalism. And so, with such an ugly picture of indiscriminate shootings into people’s homes which is often replicated by the Nigerian military, it makes a lot of sense when ""zoo"" is metaphorically used to describe Nigeria. But not to put too fine a point on it, the metaphor is a bit too polished to fit a human abattoir like Nigeria, given that in a zoo, for example, animals have value and rights. Any attempt at jungle justice, attracts serious punishments. But in the Nigerian context, there is hardly any sense of human value among Nigerian leaders and the armed forces. It is a well known historic fact that Nigerian armed forces are undisciplined, brutal, brutally corrupt, polarized, barbaric and boundless in the commission of genocides and various other atrocious crimes against humanity. Similarly, the government of Nigeria is in lockstep with them, sanctioning all the killings of unarmed civilians and then turn around to frame such events in a way that absolves them of any wrongdoings. At present, both the military and the government are indoors plotting more military operations that will soon sweep through a broad swath of Igboland. But then again, the necessary question to ask the Nigerian government and the military generals is, what more operations are you expecting your soldiers to carry out? Let me guess: they are to embark on operations in small towns, villages, marketplaces or inside family homes in Igboland where harmless children and old people are likely to be found playing or going about their businesses. Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people. But I must remind you, the members of (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=382966106593451&set=a.352828209607241&type=3,,,,,,,,33,-2.76

Nwawube Ezeobi | The Biafra Post June 1, 2020 Introduction:::::::} Mazi Nnamdi Kanu offers super prayer in the language of heaven as he asks for heavens intervention as our enemies have gathered our land. He also assured heaven that Biafra will never worship any graven image or anything born of a woman. 1. We are going to start in a way people did not expect us to. We want to lay the background on how the zoo became decayed. That humanity will understand the enormity of the problem facing those living in Nigeria. 2. Our enemies are not sleeping, the traitors are not sleeping therefore we must not sleep. Our enemies are numerous. 3. Ali Ndume is a Fulani janjaweed politician, listen to what he have to say about Nigeria, the video is everywhere, from their we will proceed. 4. Our enemies who are within are using the name of Biafra, their aim is to delay the coming of Biafra in order to please their masters. We have discovered their tactics and we are ready to defeat them. 5. Ali Ndume said they deceived people, that they are not honest. He is telling you that all of them are bad including Nigerians themselves. 6. It is their job to decieve you, it is their job to make sure you have no education. It is their job to make sure you have no jobs. Nigerians instead of fighting for their freedom, are busy fighting those fighting for them. 7. We must not get discouraged. Our determination is unquestionable. 8. If you are wondering how evil a black man can be, Ali Ndume is a good pointer. Ali Ndume is a man accused of sponsoring Boko Haram. 9. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down as a people, that is the reason why it has been easy for the Fulani janjaweed to invade our land, kill us and divide us at will. 10. They will do whatever they can to make you feel what you are doing is not working but believe you me, we are holding them at a very bad place. 11. Britain started this very concerted effort to make sure that Biafra did not see the light of the day when they found out we are the descendants of Israel that will bring light to Africa. 12. Another problem that we have is Igbo man's love for gossip and affinity to back-bite which have to do with greed, envy and jealousy that is why you have Fulanis' in our homes, bushes and markets. 13. Before the Fulani janjaweed decided to take over our land, they bribed every major media house in the world, BBC and Co. Now that they are invading, have you heard about it anywhere in the world analyzing this influx into Biafra territory?. 14. There is a global effort not to allow Biafra to emerge and the Igbo man is not helping either. These are the issues concerning us as a people and it is my duty to let the world know of it. 15. There are many things we do not appreciate or understand, that is why when we preach we use historical references that when you listen, you can never doubt it. 16. Igbo man are their own greatest enemy, when the enemy is busy planning how to take over your land, you are busy gossiping, carrying envy and being jealous. 17. Saboteurs are hiding under the name Niger Delta to delay Biafra. Anybody referring to himself as a Niger Delta, God in heaven knows you are a traitor, their job is to distract us. To make you not to come together to articulate on how to get out of the mess you are into. 18. Biafra is the second most hated people in the whole world apart from Israel. People see you and they hate you for no reason. They see the favour of God on us and they hate us. 19. If you think you are safe, just know we are surrounded. 20. The more they reduce the numbers of our listeners on Facebook, the more I preach. You think this is 1967?. When our people were intimidated by the media, as Biafrans were being massacred, you were busy lying to the world using the media - BBC. 21. Nnia Nwodo and the rest of them never rose up to challenge the issue of artificial boundary by Gowon. 22. Chukwu Okike Abiama said Biafra can never come until you go and unite all my people together. 23. It was remaining only six more months to the Biafra war and we stopped during the war, President Nixton was about to step in but Chukwu Okike Abiama made it so. 24. Once you divide the land of Biafra, Elohim will depart from us his glory will never be with you. This is what our so called elders should have considered. 25. In Otaka village in Obubua Local Government Area in Cross River State they have four market days, they circumcise their children on the eight day. They celebrate new yam festival. 26. Not that we want to force anybody to join Biafra, but we must complete the assignment Heaven gave to us. He will have to shine his light in them so they decide where to belong. 27. Asari Dokubo said he is an Igbo man. No wonder, you said you didn't know who Uchenna Asiegbu is?. Only an Igbo man will deny receiving money after he received it.

Just under seven weeks of a lockdown, and you are already screaming of hunger and begging for palliatives from Buhari. Let me assure you that whatever hardships or inconvenience you think you are suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer if war ever breaks out as a result of the ""Biafra or death"", ""Islamization"", ""Fulani jihad"", ""Fulanization"", and ""Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria"" propaganda churned out by Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF etc, and your spiritual Papas and Daddy G.Os. They have been beating the drums of propaganda and war with a very big stick, and you have been dancing furious steps to the rhythms. They tell you that Buhari wants to Islamize Nigeria, and you cheer. They say Buhari is the one arming and sending Fulani herdsmen to kill you, and you scream delightedly. They say Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria, and you believe them. They say Buhari wants to kill every Southerner along with those in the Middle-Belt, and give the vacant land to his Fulani kinsmen, and you agree. They incite the Igbos against other Nigerians, and you rejoice. They incite Christians against Muslims, and you dance for joy. They abuse Northerners and Muslims and Fulanis and the Yorubas, and you celebrate. You call Fulanis and Northerners cows. You call Nigeria a zoo and other Nigerians animals in the zoo. They tell you to get ready to fight a war and defend yourselves and your land against the Sokoto Caliphate and the sons of Usman Dan Fodio, and you scream in excitement. They call the Fulanis bloodthirsty demons from Futa Jallon, and you are giddy with delight. This is the rubbish that the PDP, CAN, NCEF, your Pastors and Daddy G.Os, Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Reno Omokri, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle-Belt forum, South-South Leaders Forum, PANDEF, etc, have been feeding you with for ages, and you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker, instead of using your braino like rational beings. They have politicised religion and weaponised it as a tool of political blackmail. They have been playing the religious card in a very dangerous and reckless manner since 2014, viciously fanning the smouldering embers of ethno-tribal and religious divisions and hatred. I want to announce to you that if and when the conflagration ignites, whatever you think you're suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer in a war situation. You are screaming for palliatives now, but nobody will give you palliatives in a war situation. I heard that in some parts of the Country, the prices of foodstuffs have risen astronomically. For example, a paint bucket of garri is now selling at N1800 in some parts of the country. The cost of satchets and bags of ""Pure Water"" have doubled. In a war situation, you will buy a paint bucket of garri for N10,000 or more, i.e if you could even see it to buy. Let me not talk about the other staples like yam, beans, rice, cassava, etc. A wrap of ""Akpu"" may cost as much as N1000. You will buy a loaf of bread for N7000, assuming it is even available. You have been shouting ""hunger"" and "" hardship"" since Buhari came to power, but in a war situation, you will know what ""hunger"" and ""hardship"" is. Then you will realize that what you are currently experiencing is Paradise in comparison. You are complaining that you are tired of staying at home because of the lockdown. In a war situation, you will most likely not even have a home to stay in; you will be too busy running for your life or hiding in the bush or the forest, or living in a refugee camp. You are complaining that health facilities are poor; in a war situation, there will be no hospitals to go to, because many of them will be bombed or razed to the ground, and the few available ones will be overflowing with war casualties. Believe you me, those your Daddy G.Os and Spiritual Papas will hop on their private jets and fly out of the Country if and when those embers of ethno-tribal and religious hate they have been fanning ignite, and leave you to face the music. Those Ohanaeze and Afenifere and Middle-Belt Forum and South-South Leaders Forum and PANDEF politicians will race to the nearest Foreign Embassy building and hide themselves there, and leave you to roast in the fire.

I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes . 19. There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 20. Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 21. Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". you see, this is how they roll. 22. That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away, that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 23. Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off, and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 24. Have you ever wondered, your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 25. Thanks to Radio Biafra, people are now listening and have started to reason. 26. Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 27. As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 28. When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 29. The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you. 30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday, and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course. 31.

Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem. Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.” He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then. He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote. But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari! Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines. This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t know of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari. Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",https://www.facebook.com/9NewsNG/photos/a.441168166232528/1472943873054947/?type=3,,,,,,,,28,-6.68

A warning that came in the wake of the indiscriminate shootings and burning down of houses by the Nigerian soldiers in a small community located somewhere in Enugu State, which surfaced on the social media on the Monday 1st of November, 2021. By every indication, the video was recorded by one of the soldiers, either as a revolt against what was being done by fellow soldiers or simply, out of sheer impudence to commit such heinous crimes and still go scot-free. But whatever be the case, the crucial factor here is that the beastly crime those soldiers committed on that day, is out there for all to see. And it is only one of many such atrocities. The point has to be made about this incident so that we do not easily forget the horror that played out that day and also to give ourselves more time to digest the facts about the vampiric mortals adorning the uniforms of the Nigerian military. As it is not out of place to think that in this 21st century, the Nigerian military ought to have evolved into a modern, refined and humane institution primed to join the league of exemplary militaries across the world in the true service of humanity. But we could not have been more wrong and presumptuous of a military stubbornly stuck up in ancient times, that continues to show itself only as a barbaric force set out to maim and kill the very people it is supposed to protect. This institution has deteriorated into a worse condition than it was, prior to the government of Muhammadu Buhari. The image of that day says it all. It speaks to the peculiar character of a military drunk with hate, coupled with an uninhibited power and authority to showcase its object of hate as it so chooses. In many ways, the characters looked far more deadlier than the weapons in their hands. A murderous set of soldiers, lethal and unforgiving by any description, firing away indiscriminately at any living thing and with relative ease and enjoyment. And in plain sight, was what seemed an infinite rage of anti-Igbo coloration, as if they were on a mission to fulfill an age-old prophetic mandate of apocalyptic retaliation. Be that as it may, this could not have been glossed over or swept under the rug anywhere else but in Nigeria. And going by the entrenched culture of impunity among the Nigerian politicians and members of the armed forces, none of these murderous soldiers or their commanders is likely to be held accountable or at least, queried by the Nigerian authorities. Which tells a very macabre yet, the true story of Nigeria; a country steeped in political and economic cannibalism. And so, with such an ugly picture of indiscriminate shootings into people’s homes which is often replicated by the Nigerian military, it makes a lot of sense when ""zoo"" is metaphorically used to describe Nigeria. But not to put too fine a point on it, the metaphor is a bit too polished to fit a human abattoir like Nigeria, given that in a zoo, for example, animals have value and rights. Any attempt at jungle justice, attracts serious punishments. But in the Nigerian context, there is hardly any sense of human value among Nigerian leaders and the armed forces. It is a well known historic fact that Nigerian armed forces are undisciplined, brutal, brutally corrupt, polarized, barbaric and boundless in the commission of genocides and various other atrocious crimes against humanity. Similarly, the government of Nigeria is in lockstep with them, sanctioning all the killings of unarmed civilians and then turn around to frame such events in a way that absolves them of any wrongdoings. At present, both the military and the government are indoors plotting more military operations that will soon sweep through a broad swath of Igboland. But then again, the necessary question to ask the Nigerian government and the military generals is, what more operations are you expecting your soldiers to carry out? Let me guess: they are to embark on operations in small towns, villages, marketplaces or inside family homes in Igboland where harmless children and old people are likely to be found playing or going about their businesses. Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people. But I must remind you, the members of (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/NoApology44/photos/a.102877998637859/211237144468610/?type=3,,,,,,,,27,-1.26

Like USA in the world where almost every community in the whole world have someone living in USA so does Lagos in the zoo, every extended family have someone living in Lagos. This is why Lagos is so influential, most especially to those in southern Nigger-Area (Nigeria). Lagos didn't just wake up to become that influential, the city was The capital of the zoo for many years before Abuja was created. The Yoruba have taken great advantage of this city to wreck havoc on the psych of the rest of the southern people. Yesterday I talked about the influence of Lagos on Igbos most especially those born in Lagos and the reactions were enormous, someone even asked me why I love Igbos so much as to care about them too much as to make such observation. He is an Izon man like myself, he didn't just know that I wrote that short stuff about Igbos as an appetizer to write about my Izon people and the rest of the coastal people attitude towards Igbo and Biafra ideology at last. In my articles I try to spend much time talking about Igbo weaknesses because I consider Igbos to have the greatest population of enlightened people in the zoo. Majority of Igbos know what they want from any political system and they have realized that Nigeria can never work for Biafrans but most of my coastal people are still reserving some hope in the zoo except those in the struggle for Biafra restoration. Now to the topic of the day, Lagos influence on the coastal people of Biafra. I was born in Lagos like many others but thanks to Elohim who relocated my father back to Biafraland where I grew up with fellow Biafrans and mixed up with my blood. Our play as kids were slangs from different Biafran languages unlike the Yoruba tenses I and my siblings came from Lagos with. In just few years everything about Lagos washed off from my head and replaced with Biafran. But my closest cousins were not so lucky. They grew up in Lagos. I grew up having Lagos present in my house as most of my cousins will first visit our house before going to other places at Igweocha or environs. They always told me about Lagos and how things are done there. So as as a child, I was gathering information about Lagos. Overtime, I noticed that these my cousins, uncles and aunts except few are so into speaking of Yoruba and addicted to Lagos. I also discovered that Lagos has her own seed it leaves in someone who have accepted her that you won't consider your place attractive or consider your culture to be beautiful. Many of my relatives became Yoroizons. Izon by blood but Yoruba by every other things. Some of them even took up Yoruba names. Growing up as a child, I never liked it but I couldn't understand why it was like that until I graduated and got a job that brought me to live in Lagos, unlike before where I only visit and spend few days or one or two weeks. This time I had to live with the local people and I found out what happened to my cousins who grew up here. I discovered that Yorubas always pretend to love the coastal Biafrans more than any other part of the zoo. They will call you Ibo yet expect you to join them and hate Igbo people. When they call you omo Ibo, they want you to say you are not Igbo but Niger Delta like most of our people always do, then they will love you. They will do everything to get you to hate hinterland Igbo or if you can't hate them they will try to make you avoid them by telling you how arrogant an Igbo man is or how crafty they are or how domineering they could be. If they fail to get you to buy all these then you are gone. Just get ready to face persecution. You will never be able to make true friends from among them and the Igbos they have influenced. Those YoroIbos will be feeling like for you to love Igbo as much as you do being someone not from Igbo then maybe you are an Igbo wanna be. This they feel because they have abandoned their Igboness for Yoruba acceptance. All a coastal Biafran needs to do to be accepted in Lagos is to hate Igbo and take that hatred home. All they want you to do is to join them in gossiping about Igbo and how Igbos are this and that. They don't have any problem if you love yourself as an Izon or Urhobo or Ogoni or Ibibio etc. They really don't care about all that provided they can take Igbo out of the way and present Yoruba as a friendly ethnic nationality they are satisfied. Please don't get me wrong, there are still some very nice Yoruba people in Lagos but most of these ones are not interested in politics or political discussions. Don't forget, this programming has been there since after the war and most of the most influential people in coastal Biafra are those who had lived outside in large cities like Lagos. They are the ones who come back home with warped mentality and join politics.

And the need for Igbos to return Investment home 

Between Lagos No Man's Land And Anambra Home For All 

I want to posits that the Igbophobia  in lagos or elsewhere  in the zoo called Nigeria is burn out of indepth tribal hatred on Ndigbo and  while the popular Lagos is no man's land quotes is a mere blackmail and falsehood on Ndigbo in lagos because the popular quote was invented by a former Lagos state Governor Lateef Kayode Jakode and not Igbo man persie read this link for details https://www.nairaland.com/7623888/lagos-no-mans-land-invented

Those fanning the ember of hate  against the Igbos  with an excuse that Igbos claims that Lagos is a no man's land like fami fani Kayode  inciting  ethinic violence and provocative comments for his political gain are most uncivilized and unaware  backward species of  human being that lack  common history.

No man's land phrase  of Lagos does not imply the abolishment of Indigenous people of Lagos  rather the multiethnic population that Lagos enjoys which  Onitsha, Nnewi, and Aba also should  enjoy  even more than Lagos but because of the Igbophobia in Nigeria this leverage and privilege were deprived from Igbos in Onitsha, Nnewi and Aba by systematically closing down every industries situated in Biafra land and closing down of every existing sea ports in Igbo land and Biafra land in general which consist of all former eastern Nigeria region 

Onitsha has been and are still a  commercial city   regards as the largest international market  in the whole of  west Africa since the colonial era before Lagos. For this facts and in the spirit of welcoming multiethnic population in their commercial hubs they nicknamed Anambra State Home for all . Home for all also means home for Yorubas, Hausa,, Fulani  and other ethincities in the zoo and outside the zoo called Nigeria   to welcome multiethnic population in their commercial city which Ndigbo built by themselves without any government assistance.  and no Anambra man persie has made  complaints that their home cannot be for all but for themselves. But wonder  in Yoruba land where a man whose ancestral origin is from Osun state incite touts to go destroy properties they didn't build and confiscate lands they did not own or bought or have sold out to Ndigbo because Yoruba owns Lagos not Igbos, this a high level of ethinic hatred against igbos that Femi fanni Kayode who one time disguise self and a true friend of the Igbos and a good in-law was claiming to be speaking out against the margalization of the Igbos in Nigeria now displaying his true colour of hate against the Ndigbo.

This again  has validated  Indigenous people of Biafra call for independent  state of Biafra  and their recent call for Biafra exodus from Lagos and other part of Nigeria outside Biafra land . Ndigbo must make haste while the sun shines . Nigeria is not one country let alone one nation and the hatrd against Ndigbo is not going to stop any time soon as much as politic of hate and religious division has been the bases to enforce fraudlent one Nigeria establishment . The bigotry statement of Some Yorubas during this era of the Nigeria jamboree selections called election should be à wake up call to Ndigbo who still think that they are component part of this British creation. Do not forget so soon that during the recent campaign  these same set of people campaigning against igbos taking over Lagos are thesame people who campaigned against voting an Easterner with claim that  under Peter Obi administration those infrastructure that the federal government denied Ndigbo such as railroad, Seaport and international airport shall be built. Añd If that happens their shall be mass exodus of Ndigbo from Lagos to Igbo land as Ndigbo Igbo will prefer retuning their investment home thereby coursing Lagos to be deserted and all the taxes that Lagos government are gaining will reduce coursing the fall of Lagos .Now today thesame set of people has manuover themselves to victory yet they are not satisfied they keep inciting violence against the Igbo business and properties in lagos . Do you see why we must return home at all cost .the time is now . Igbos wake up

When you hear other tribe joining them to castigated Biafra don't blame them, anybody who is castigating Biafra will not make heaven. 23. This happened in the late 40's and Buhari has replicated the same northernisation and fulanisation. 24. Now let me prove it to you that what this man is saying over 60 years ago is still active today. 25. I have given you the first Fulani Gordy agenda of Fulanisation headed by Amadu Bello a reprobate. 26. The daughter of Abba Kyari is the one controlling the whole money of the Zoo and all of you are there shouting one Nigeria like mad people. 27. How God sent the unknown gun men we don't know but we are praying for them. 28. Let me remind some of you fools like Hope Uzodima. He said we hijacked ESN. 29. Hope Uzodima don't you wear Pampers and your fellow men are busy destroying you. 30. When they invite you to Sokoto that night you start sweating because you know what they will do you in the night. 31. NO MORE FUND RAISING IN THE ZOO, YOU ARE SOLDIERS YOU STAY IN THE BUSH UNTIL YOU ARE REFILLED . 32. On this note we have come to the end of this programme. Here on Radio Biafra is where we worship and Chukwu Okike Abiama is our God. From me from here is Good evening.

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU! Long live Nnamdi Kanu!!

When people started trending Simon Ekpa as the New Director of Radio Biafra, I was surprised at their ignorance. I asked myself how Broadcasting from Radio Biafra translate to being the Director of Radio Biafra. Even some PDP charlatans have started trending Ekpa as the New Leader of Radio Biafra. And they have started using propaganda against the young man. Let me also state it here that like many of us, Simon Ekpa was previously for a better Nigeria. Me too, there was a time I was writing and asking that Nigeria should restructure as the only way to sustain the country. I continued this, until I found out that Nigeria as a country can never get better. At least not with the Islamization and Fulanization agenda of the Fulani. The North sees Restructuring as handing over to the South. So it won't happen. I noticed this and hands up from the ignorance and stupidity called quest for Restructuring. Let me tell you here that those still shouting Restructuring are ignorant. So, you see, we all didn't wake up one day and started agitating for Biafra. We all have our stories and how Nigeria happened to us. Simon Ekpa was a political commentator before he joined IPOB. Simon was sympathetic to PDP and have written many works for PDP. Mr Ekpa lost interest in Nigeria and everything about Nigeria after the rigging in 2019. Simon couldn't believe it. He noticed, like I did many years ago that Nigeria is unsalvageable. He then launched what he called, changing the narrative of yesterday. This campaign saw Simo Ekpa starting to speak about Biafra. For him, Nigeria is gone and only Biafra can save us. When Mr Simon Ekpa started this new campaign, he was so real, but some of us have their doubts. So I personally commented on his wall, asking him never to change. I must say that till today, Ekpa have shown more dedication to Biafra restoration than any other thing he has ever embarked on. I am saying all these for you to understand exactly whom Simon Ekpa was before he joined the struggle. I am saying it because with his current position in IPOB, lots of propaganda will be coming from the desk of PDP members. I have warned our people to see PDP as same with APC. The two groups doesn't want Nigeria to divide, and can do anything to keep this corrupt center going. They two are your enemies. When you see them bring up videos or write ups Mr Ekpa made as a supporter of PDP some few years ago, please do disregard it. They are just trying to put doubt in you. Those that don't know should know it now that even our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was once in APGA. He once believed that with APGA, we can take over entire political structure in Biafra land and use it to move for Biafra independence, but he also found out that it can't work in a zoo. That's why he looked at people saying we should join politics, vote and elect those with Biafra mindset as jokers. He has been there and knows it can't work. I am happy to read the bellow clarification from Mr Simon Ekpa concerning the situation of things. Those questioning every directives of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are not true Comrades. They will keep writing trash, after which they will come to apologise. And I wonder why they are not tired of apology. Read this words from Mr Ekpa and be guided. Mr Ekpa will be broadcasting through Radio Biafra and not the New Director of Radio Biafra or Leader of IPOB. Hear Mazi Simon Ekpa... -------------------------------- ""Let me rhetorically state that there is no vacuum in the leadership of IPOB, there is no vacuum in the position of director of Radio Biafra. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu remain the Director of Radio Biafra and his directive is final as we maintain the command and control. Our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will continue to lead the struggle from where ever he is, be it in the prison, DSS custody, police detention or from AsoRock detention. The directive of our leader on the 8th of July 2021 is that I, Simon Ekpa should start broadcasting from Radio Biafra with immediate effect, to maintain the legacy and sustain the momentum of the movement, a task I accepted without hesitation because the situation requires extra ordinary media war to sustain, expose the impunity of the Nigeria State, to expose the genocide and end the enslavement of indigenous people in Nigeria in a different level. Whoever have issues with this should check him or herself. The directive of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is not just a wish, it is an order. I am Simon Ekpa, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s disciple on Biafra restoration. On this day, 10.7.2021."" ---------------------------------- Dearest Simon Ekpa, know it that we support you. Also know it that every body must not like you.

An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. We are doing the best we can to make sure we come to you Live and Direct!!! However, we are going to see what we can do to rectify the problem, but if all efforts fail, or should there be any interruption during the broadcast of which I am sure there will be, please use other platform such as our Radio Biafra App. Darkness can not stop us this evening. 3. Tonight we start by laying a background as we normally do. 4. Such an important and critical meeting you have been asking for ages , and now you finally got it and what did you do? you run quickly to Abuja, acting to be in control of IPOB, can you imagine such an utter garbage. 5. All of you who have been advising me to take it easy with Ohaneze, you tell me, what have we done to them now? 6. Somebody has even said that having a meeting with Ohaneze is like Aburi Accord, they will say one thing and do another thing. 7. I don't want people to say that we are stubborn and we don't listen, now we have given them the opportunity and have you seen where it led us? 8. They even said in their press release that IPOB should work hand in hand with Tony Nnadi one man band, onye ara bu file akpaghari. 9. This was the same thing they did when we had the JANJAWEED ebe di njo, and they have done it again. 10. So this has been their plan all along, so that they can show their masters that they are in control. 11. We must continue, we have to continue. 12. There was a Revolution now that happened in Abuja today, and you should have seen the convoy of military men and police and many people were arrested just for doing a protest. 13. The army said that they have no men to fight Bokoharam and protect families in Southern Kaduna, but you have more men, and more men to go and arrest protesters. 14. You've heard of violence protest going on around the world and none has been arrested. 15. The army left the war front, the army left Southern Kaduna to go and arrest those who are fighting for you for a better living. 16. Some of you forgot that communism collapsed in Soviet union because soldiers refused to shoot at the protesters. 17. Some of you, you wake up in the morning , you wear that your stupid army uniform, or civil defense uniform, you go out to arrest people who are fighting for freedom for the looters. 18. I don't know what is wrong with the HAUSA, the same mistakes you made in the past, you are repeating today. 19. Hausa I am asking you, does it mean you people enjoy being slaves? 20. Have you not seen the video of the national guard in America that were called out to stop protesters, and later joined the protesters? 21. Some of you fools cannot reason very well, if you are privileged with a bit of a common sense , you won't be going out there to arrest those fighting for your freedom. 22. Britain knows that Fulani owes Bokoharam and ISWAP, have they killed anyone? It appears that the more armed you are , the more you are feared and respected. 23. You are carrying a gun arresting someone who are fighting for good road , there is something wrong with a black man's head? 24. I keep asking a black man, don't you have shame? That a white man can come and build you a country. 25. You shouting one Nigeria, ask yourself this question, why is it that when FULANI'S are attacking when you call the army they won't respond? 26. They planned what they are doing many years ago, including the idiots that are going about arresting people and yet your villages are under siege, your mothers are being raped. 27. We are not fighting for marginalisation, we are fighting for freedom and we are not waiting for anyone. 28. Come and join IPOB, let's join hands and make Biafra another Japan. 29. Breaking News!!!!! ISIS and Al-Qaeda are planning to invade the South , and they will take it. What happened to Israel will happen to us, we will have to fight our way back in. 30. As some of you sabo are busy doing your work for the ZOO, some of you your mothers will be raped. 31. And I kept asking them, what are you doing in the ZOO army? 32. All if you idiots canvassing for igbo presidency, let me tell you, the history of your people they kill. you're here you run away to another place, they kept killing you and you are running around like a stomach upset. 33. Thunder will fire all of you fighting for new Nigeria gabarge, you will all will die a painful death. 34. You want to contest for Nigeria Nigeria Presidency, they hate you , Fulani hates you , you are like a goat following the owner , one day they will slaughter you and use you for celebration. 35. All of you idiots has forgotten what they are doing to you , but tonight am here to remind you. 36.

▪️Compiled By Biafra Reporters |April 19, 2020

1. At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo).

2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive.

3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo.

4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled.

5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home.

6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction.

7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way.

8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored.
I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come.

9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it.

10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition.

11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards.

12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency.

13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake.

14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth.

15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business.

16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria.

17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history.

18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them.

19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos.

20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible.

21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil.
22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it.

When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes.

23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land.
Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed.

Some will still hate you and run you down. This time have taught me better. That not all truly want a Biafra away from Nigeria. Let me tell you the truth. Many rich men both in government and markets in Igbo land don't want Biafra to come. Nigeria as a country give them chance to make huge illegal money. How can you expect a governor in Nigeria that can squander money for 8 years and nothing will happen to want Biafra to be restored. After the squandering, he will go on to win senatorial seat and continue the looting from there. What of a business man that goes to China to request for substandard goods? What of the fake producer of wine in our markets distributing cancer to our people and making huge amounts of money? What of the criminals on our roads masquerading as policemen? What of the immigration officers in our airports collecting 100 dollars from first time travelers? What of the rapists and killers of youths masquerading as Nigeria soldiers? These guys are money bags and they are all out to end this struggle. They have the money and they are doing their best to end it. Biafra is what Nigeria can't be. The duty of these people is to either end IPOB or hand it over to them so that Biafra can become more evil and useless than their Nigeria. These people have bought over criminals that subscribed to IPOB thinking they can make money from it. Some IPOB members thought what IPOB is doing is to end today's oppressors and become tomorrow's oppressors. This was how MASOB derailed. They gave themselves governors of localities and turned themselves gods. They started bullying and extorting money from our people. Their reputation killed and gradually they died a natural death. These dubi-ous men joined IPOB too. They were thinking that when Biafra is restored, they will just be given positions that will allow them to steal. A true freedom fighter must understand that the end game is freedom. He must be ready to be willing to restore Biafra and enthrone laws that will guide every body, and turn the Biafra leader into a people's servant. This is the Biafra of our dreams. Not a Biafra you behave any how, act anyhow and lord it over others. It is not a Biafra you turn yourself into a god simply because you won ordinary governorship election. The sponsors of the infiltrators are the dubi-ous politicians, corrupt businessmen and women. They have recruited criminals among us to try and destroy what we are doing. These criminals will always shout that they are standing on the truth, but can't be proud to say or mention that truth they are standing on. They cannever be proud of that truth. I tell you this day. You must not succumb to them. Anyone telling you to make peace with them is your enemy. No infiltrator or supporter of infiltrators is your comrade. You must see them as worse than the oppressors. You must rise up against them. IPOB must take record of all of them supporting this madness and send them packing. No infiltrator must be allowed into any position in IPOB. Not even the position of a floor member. By so doing, you are not only protecting the struggle, you are also protecting and safeguarding the lives of our people. Every genuine IPOB member should understand that it is you against these criminals. I tell you this always. A hungry man is not just someone that is not rich. Most rich people in Nigeria are actually hungry. You can be rich or poor and still be hungry. This is why Nigeria politicians upon all their riches are still looting. This is why they were able to buy over lots of them abroad, and they contacted some of them in the zoo and rendered them one or two help and they sold their conscience. We must be careful. We must protect this struggle from these criminals. They might hate you today, but they will soon be defeated. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be released. He will chastise those that became indiscipline. He will maintain the sack of all the dubi-ous infiltrators. He will not give room for what happened this time to happen again.

Some Ndi Igbo who claim to support a homogeneous Igbo, nation, but are supporters of One Useless Nigeria will always accuse IPOB of forcing unwilling people into Biafra. Then some unreasonable people from coastal Biafra will come there to pontificate how they are being forced to join Biafra. I truly wonder if you all are well at all? How can people be forced when Referendum is involved? No one forced Britain to opt out of EU. They voted out in a well organized referendum and so be it. If you are Igbo and you believe that majority of Ijaw people hate Ndi Igbo. Then while worry, since they will go through a referendum? If truly they hate Ndi Igbo, they should be voting No and not Yes. If you are Ijaw and you think your people should not have anything to do with Ndi Igbo, then go into referendum and embrace your No. Or Could it be that you don't want referendum, so that the people won't have a say? Do referendum mean a force to you? The reason Mazi Nnamdi Kanu said that Biafra referendum will be according to nations under Biafra, is to make sure no body will claim that they were overshadowed, forced or intimidated into voting Yes or No. Efik will vote for themselves and if they vote No, no one will question them. Same with Ijaw and other nations in Biafra. No one should ever think that he or she is doing Ndi Igbo a favor by accepting Biafra. You are doing only yourself a favor. Igbo people are numerous. They are in South East, South South and even in Northern state of Benue. I have said it and will continue to say it. We are leaving this zoo, it doesn't matter if we have to do it alone. Stop behaving like a woman being wooed by a man. In this sacred struggle, there will be no special treatment. Stop saying what Ndi Igbo should do is to seek for unity and build bridges. You yourself, what should you do? Don't you also know how to build bridges and seek for unity? I think this Nigeria majority/minority nonsense has gone into some people's brain and damaged it. Why should a tribe her population is 4th largest in Nigeria be called minority? Even Igala too is minority in Nigeria. That's a tribe that were dubiously divided into four and joined to four different States. Yet they answer minority and carry it like a badge. Hear them .....'the minority tribes in Niger Delta'. A slave name that unites them into slavery and marginalization. In Biafra there won't be minority and majority. That's because every nation will be in charge of whatever they have. They will make their own local laws and retain their identity. Biafra existed in 1967 under Odumegwu Ojukwu. And was put off in 1970. Today, IPOB under Mazi Nnamdi Kanu seeks to restore her. If you think you don't want to be part of that Biafra again, vote No when the time for referendum comes. Elochukwu Ohagi, 2020.",,,,,,,,,21,-2.05

When next you want to accuse the Igbos, you must put this into consideration. Stop accusing the Igbos wrongly because the Igbos do not hate Nigeria and Nigerians. Igbos are peaceful nation-builders. Igbos believe in one Nigeria. Igbos do not abuse other tribes. Igbos can never call Nigeria a zoo or chastise Nigeria. Igbos believe that we have challenges in Nigeria that can be solved with peace and mutual understanding, and that is why Igbos are still migrating and developing every regions despite the unsavory noise of secession. The majority of those causing disaffection that you call Igbos are not Igbos, they are IPOBs. IPOBs are not Igbos. We have Igbos and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The IPOB call themselves the ""Indigenous People of Biafra"", and call those of us that are Igbos, efulefus. So, in Igbo land, we have Igbos and IPOB. Igbo is Igbo. Igbo is unadulterated. Those who call themselves the IPOB have infiltrated the Igbos and Igbo land with evil. All Igbos like me are harbingers of unity, peace and progress, but they call us efulefus. The so-called Indigenous People are unreal Igbos and they are the harbingers and supporters of the present terrorism and evil in Igbo land. So, whenever you want to say anything against the Igbos, just know that the Igbos are different from the Indigenous People of Biafra. When the indigenous people commit crime with the name Igbo, do not accuse the Igbo nation. Accuse the IPOB group. I am an Igbo man. I believe in unity and progress. I believe in one united Nigeria. ~ Chijioke Paul Okeifufe",,,,,,,,,21,-1.67

There are also some emotional fools that embraced the struggle. These guys are so emotional that they lack reasoning and tact. They are ready to work for Mr Ekpa because they think and believe the zoo needs to be taught a lesson. They mistake teaching the zoo a lesson with terro-rising their own people. They will aid the destruction of the same struggle they so much cherished. The aim of recruiting Mr Ekpa by the government is to help make the people hate the movement. The greatest problem facing Nigeria government is the fact that almost 90% of Ndị Igbo are pro IPOB. This needs to be punctured. And how can this be done. By terro-rizing the people in the name of freedom, IPOB and Biafra. There is a limit to what the people can take. The story of freedom is always beautiful, but the journey is always painful. Remember the Israelites on their way out of Egypt? They all were happy to leave Egypt at first, but on the way they faced difficulties and murmured against God and Moses. They wished to go back to Egypt and suffer than face what they are presently facing in the name of going to the promise land. Nigeria government desperately need the people of Biafra to turn against this very struggle and that is the job of Mr Ekpa. They will continue to terro-rize the people to the extent that the people will rise up against their own freedom. Don't forget that many are not registered IPOB members but they are fully in support of IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Imagine a situation where Mr Ekpa's gangs on ground starts terro-rising them that they start working against the struggle. This will Isolate the registered members to the extent that they will go underground or even denounce their struggle. Remember that many hard cores are already struggling.

They will even go after those writing for IPOB that are on ground.

There have been shooting of youths at Lekki Tollgate, Aba, Enugu, Ondo, Onitsha etc, yet these guys left all these to write hateful posts against Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Really? You did think it was Mazi Nnamdi Kanu that was responsible for the atrocities happening in Nigeria. You did think it was him that hid the palliatives away from them. At times I ask myself what exactly these people wants. Do they really want a better Nigeria or could it be a better pocket they wanted? Why is it that they helped the political elements to attribute tribe to the #EndSARS protest. What exactly did they set out to gain? What exactly? After Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's latest interview and his intelligent response to issues, some of them instead of acknowledging the fact that the man is intelligent, kept gossiping around. ""What has his intelligence done towards bringing us Biafra"", one of them asked. This guy is a believer in One useless Nigeria. He is doing absolutely nothing for Biafra restoration, yet he will keep asking useless questions. What Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wants is freedom for all. A situation where everyone, including the Hausa and those of them in the middle belt can live freely as humans. He has repeatedly said he is not against your Restructuring. He has even submitted to the zoo government some conditions that can be termed Restructuring before. When the opportunity came to speak out, he did not sit at the fence to gossip like you guys. He joined his voice with that of the Nigeria youths to speak against police brutality and bad governance. But for you guys, it looks like what you people do is to speak for the oppressors. Your hate for MNK has so beclouded you all that all you do is to gossip, and helping BMC to circulate fake video audio in other to discredit the #EndSARS protest and make it look like it is #IPOB thing. I say shame on you guys. Instead of gossiping, why not lend your voice with the courageous Nigeria youths who have in 100s paid the ultimate prize for a better future.

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri. We are the descendants of Gad. Go to your history book and make your research.

We have suffered, the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy 13.

The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine? 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37. On that note we have come to the end of this broadcast, as always, Biafra is our religion and on this platform Radio Biafra is where we worship, with all the love in me, from me, from here, it is Good evening COMPILED by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P)",https://www.facebook.com/biafraisours/photos/a.3423486421013131/4181396338555465/?type=3,,,,,,,,18,-3.28

Hate him or not dude is doing a lot for you. If not for him, by now maybe myself particularly might be answering AHMED AMINU KUCHO and nothing is going to happen. This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU!

A warning that came in the wake of the indiscriminate shootings and burning down of houses by the Nigerian soldiers in a small community located somewhere in Enugu State, which surfaced on the social media on the Monday 1st of November, 2021. By every indication, the video was recorded by one of the soldiers, either as a revolt against what was being done by fellow soldiers or simply, out of sheer impudence to commit such heinous crimes and still go scot-free. But whatever be the case, the crucial factor here is that the beastly crime those soldiers committed on that day, is out there for all to see. And it is only one of many such atrocities. The point has to be made about this incident so that we do not easily forget the horror that played out that day and also to give ourselves more time to digest the facts about the vampiric mortals adorning the uniforms of the Nigerian military. As it is not out of place to think that in this 21st century, the Nigerian military ought to have evolved into a modern, refined and humane institution primed to join the league of exemplary militaries across the world in the true service of humanity. But we could not have been more wrong and presumptuous of a military stubbornly stuck up in ancient times, that continues to show itself only as a barbaric force set out to maim and kill the very people it is supposed to protect. This institution has deteriorated into a worse condition than it was, prior to the government of Muhammadu Buhari. The image of that day says it all. It speaks to the peculiar character of a military drunk with hate, coupled with an uninhibited power and authority to showcase its object of hate as it so chooses. In many ways, the characters looked far more deadlier than the weapons in their hands. A murderous set of soldiers, lethal and unforgiving by any description, firing away indiscriminately at any living thing and with relative ease and enjoyment. And in plain sight, was what seemed an infinite rage of anti-Igbo coloration, as if they were on a mission to fulfill an age-old prophetic mandate of apocalyptic retaliation. Be that as it may, this could not have been glossed over or swept under the rug anywhere else but in Nigeria. And going by the entrenched culture of impunity among the Nigerian politicians and members of the armed forces, none of these murderous soldiers or their commanders is likely to be held accountable or at least, queried by the Nigerian authorities. Which tells a very macabre yet, the true story of Nigeria; a country steeped in political and economic cannibalism. And so, with such an ugly picture of indiscriminate shootings into people’s homes which is often replicated by the Nigerian military, it makes a lot of sense when ""zoo"" is metaphorically used to describe Nigeria. But not to put too fine a point on it, the metaphor is a bit too polished to fit a human abattoir like Nigeria, given that in a zoo, for example, animals have value and rights. Any attempt at jungle justice, attracts serious punishments. But in the Nigerian context, there is hardly any sense of human value among Nigerian leaders and the armed forces. It is a well known historic fact that Nigerian armed forces are undisciplined, brutal, brutally corrupt, polarized, barbaric and boundless in the commission of genocides and various other atrocious crimes against humanity. Similarly, the government of Nigeria is in lockstep with them, sanctioning all the killings of unarmed civilians and then turn around to frame such events in a way that absolves them of any wrongdoings. At present, both the military and the government are indoors plotting more military operations that will soon sweep through a broad swath of Igboland. But then again, the necessary question to ask the Nigerian government and the military generals is, what more operations are you expecting your soldiers to carry out? Let me guess: they are to embark on operations in small towns, villages, marketplaces or inside family homes in Igboland where harmless children and old people are likely to be found playing or going about their businesses. Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people.

For one, it was a gangster act. For another, it was a sleek score for Nigerian Intelligence. For the Igboho saga, no one saw the attack as act of heroism. It was a forest cat nibbling a rat. But the matter for this essayist started before the two onslaughts. The intelligence forces invited the acerbic cleric Gumi over. It was not to probe or poke him. His hoary beard and whirlwind tongue remained intact. It was the show before the show-off. They gave Gumi a slap on the wrist. Kanu had cuffs on the wrist. For a different grist, Igboho had blood on his street. I wonder how a southern priest chummy with bandits would have swayed under this state? Would he have the fortitude to walk the forest aisles? Would he not be tagged a rebel leader or collaborator? Will they say he gave a baptismal fire to bandits? Or will they call him an anointer of the men of blood? Won’t they coerce him to bare the geographical details of their hideouts. Won’t they go to their bush havens, bomb and flush them out, and put paid to the narrative of mayhem and slaughter? Why the lopsided magistracy? Why is it rage here, and softness there, when all over we need the equality of official justice? Yet, I have no tears to shed for Kanu, or a case to make for an ethnic entrepreneur who slayed peace in his homeland he sought to save, called Yoruba clerics to be stoned to death, carried the passport of a zoo country and, by implication, making himself a zoo ambassador or a monkey or hyena in the babel of caged squealers. He consecrated cutting the ears or lopping off heads, paralysed a region for his ego for a few days. The people feared his security forces more than the official ones. He virtually committed a coup in the east, atrophied official Nigeria in the region, and installed a de facto Biafra. In spite of Operation Python Dance, the Igbo dreaded the ESN more. The snake crawled as though coy when Kanu squalled. The centre watched like a spectator. It recalls the rebellion under the geriatric King David in the Bible when one of his sons ogled the throne. “And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest not.” For me, it makes little sense to speculate whether it was right to pick him up or not. How naïve Kanu was to allow kudi to lure him out of his lair. It shows how half-cooked a rebel or hero he is, and how he pined for the lush life of the flesh, as Lai Mohammed said. Lai Mohammed may be right, but he was wrong-headed. Is it not in the same government that we have seen men, like the attorney general, mint parties? He made financial excess into moral excrescence in the extravagance of Naira rain? We must not forget that it was Buhari, who made Kanu into a monster. Just as Mazisi Kunene in his epic poem turned Shaka the Zulu into a monster by killing his love Noliwe, Buhari made Kanu into a gradual descent into a hate machine. In the Jonathan years, he was an outlier, an irritant and, at best, an entertainer. The Jonathan administration made the Igbo the centre. His middle name was Azikiwe. He gave appointments and contracts to their elites. When oil was over $100 dollars per barrel, he did not see the bad roads in the region, or do any consequential project for the folks. But they were happy with him. Sentiment upended welfare. Enter Buhari. The opposite is the story. Buhari has done more work in infrastructure for the east with his trojan of works, Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) than any leader since Gowon. But Buhari stirred the eastern fury. He alienated them in appointments, and tars them as pariah in his rhetoric. He has up till today not learned how to speak with them. He speaks at them. Even if he paves the eastern infrastructure in gold, they will not hug him. It is a lesson in leadership sanctified in the words of Oscar Wilde: sentiment is more important than reason. We may recall that Soyinka hails Amaechi for the western train and would not acknowledge Buhari. History will however restore that credit. Not now. History is repeating itself in the north. Buhari is doing to the north what Jonathan did to the east. He is plying the elite with appointments while neglecting the streets. Especially in security. His northern elite may like him, but their people are suffering. They are dying on the streets, their blood mixing with their farm millets and corns. Their daughters are losing their virginal flow to goons. Their wives are widowed in their teens. The talakawa politician has suddenly lost the ability to look down over his high shoulders. There was an obsession with Kanu, and it might have accounted for why he put off his trip for medical check-up. That can wake up his biological clock. Finding Kanu might have refuelled his haemoglobin and reengineered his heartbeat. What a health boost. The obsession was funny when a northern group gave a 100 million Naira bounty on Kanu’s head, (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/674030592625923/photos/a.696196440409338/4653648967997379/?type=3,,,,,,,,16,-4.25

This is where Ojukwu and Ironsi missed it at the beginning

Aguiyi Ironsi and Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu were both faithful servants of the Zoo called Nigeria as military men. First, they worked  together to stop the first revolution of Nigeria by a coastal Igbo Biafran, Kaduna Nzeogwu. They arrested him and sentenced him to death.

Same Ironsi and Ojukwu worked together as well and stopped Isaac Boro's declaration of coastal Biafra nation he named Niger Delta republic. They also arrested him, killed about 150 of his men and sentenced him to death.

All these were done in the name of one Nigeria. This means that as servants of the Nigerian State, they stopped two Biafran revolutions in one year, 1966. One was a revolution for better Nigeria like the Izon son Sowore is doing today and the other was the revolution for an independent Coastal Biafran state similar to what we are doing in IPOB.

Mind you, the reasons for both actions were marginalisation and misconduct of political office holders. Such political ideologies should have been better managed, mostly the one calling for an independent state outside Nigeria but none of that was done and the death sentences only created more bad blood just as the attempt to kill Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in 2017 created more hate for Nigeria by Biafrans. Same occured in the coast.

Before long, Ironsi was killed and power sapped by force from him. Then the massive killing of Biafrans with emphasis on Igbos followed.

Mind you, Ojukwu had not yet realized what evil Nigeria truly is. He still thought things could be remedied because he still believed in the Zoo called Nigeria. He patiently pushed until the Ghanaian Head of State, General Ankra invited Ojukwu and Gowon to settle the Nigerian dispute and agreements were reached.

As it is the way of the Zoo, they don't keep to their words, they dumped Aburi Accord agreement as Buhari dumped Jonathan's 2014 Confab report.

Then the leaders of the East that made up the Eastern Assembly after being pushed by some traditional leaders led by HRM the Mingi Tem of Nembe came together and said enough is enough.

While Ojukwu was still in Lagos on official visit, they met on 27th of May 1967 and decided to leave Nigeria for good and Frank Opigo, the then Yenagoa Provincial Governor presented the name Biafra to the house as delivered to him by the King of Nembe, one of the most notable kings in Izon Nation and about the most respected King in the then Yenagoa province which is today Bayelsa State.

The Eastern Assembly accepted the name with joy and wrote a letter to Ojukwu telling him their decision with the condition that if he chooses not to accept their decision that they will pick another leader that is capable to lead them out of Nigeria. 

At last, Ojukwu had no choice. He had to serve his people so he did same thing he arrested Isaac Boro for and declared the Eastern region of Nigeria as Biafra which covers Boro's coastal Biafra which he named Niger Delta.

It is expected that Ojukwu should have still maybe called Boro or invite him to explain himself now they are on same path but that never happened whether by omission or commission I can't tell.

The war started and Gowon got hold of Boro and unleashed him against his own people and killed him after he had delivered Rivers State to their hands.

It was Isaac Adaka Boro who founded the amphibious brigade in the Nigerian Army. If not for him, Nigeria Army wouldn't have been able to counter Biafra in the coast. Don't forget, there were also many coastal Biafrans on the part of the Biafran army.

After everything today, we are back to square one and our enemies are eating our destiny at our expense.

We must learn from history and not repeat same mistakes.

We cannot ignore the little efforts made by others while we were ignorant and we must never blame others for the days that they were ignorant because as some would say, the time you wake up is your morning.

Yesterday, the coastal Biafrans were at the forefront of the battle fighting for resource control that if they had succeeded, everyone in the Zoo would have benefited from it. Today, we are fighting for the total restoration of Biafra.

We must see the struggle for the restoration of Biafra as the continuation of the Niger Delta struggle for resource control or else we will miss it because we demanded for resource control, they gave us the Greek gift (Amnesty) to shut us up. Now, we are demanding for our country Biafra so that resource control we can't get we must give it to ourselves in our own country.

Deji has not been just a critic; he has been everything evil to Kanu and his self-determination seeking group, IPOB. A critic pokes holes in a man’s actions with fact-based alternative opinions, but Deji thrived on calumny, falsehood, malice, assault, hate and an obvious wish for the worst. He spited Kanu time without number, calling him a coward for surviving the attack on his home by the murderous Nigerian military and escaping to Israel for recuperation. To him, Kanu would have stayed back and allow the blood-sucking Nigerian soldiers kill him so that the Biafran dream would be stalled. The vile-filled comrade went so low when, filled with frustration, he did a video in which he expressed an unparalleled hatred for Nnamdi Kanu, showcasing his lying expertise in a manner that could send even Lia Mohammed and his protégé, Femi Adesina, into hiding. Deji’s frustration stemmed from Kanu’s call on Biafrans to boycott the 2019 general elections – a strategy that Obafemi Awolowo himself applied in the sixties. Seeking to ridicule Kanu, he dared to compare self with him (Kanu), claiming that he (Deji) has staged several protests and been arrested many times by Nigerian police yet did not run out from the country. The embittered critic however turned a new leaf after receiving the beating of his life from ordinary almajiris on the street of Abuja and consequentially fleeing to Dubai. Taking to his twitter handle, he wrote, “Let me specially thank Egbon @realFFK for rebuilding the bridge of friendship with my brother Mazi Nnamdi Kanu & yes, I expressed regrets over many of my criticism of him. It’s only in a Zoo that characters like Buhari are fit to be leaders. Nigeria never had it this bad before.” The above tweet thus confirms Femi Fani-Kayode’s earlier assertion that Deji has apologized to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and that Kanu in turn accepted the apology. Pundits believe that, having realized the hopelessness of the animal kingdom called Nigeria, Deji, like Omoyele Sowere, will stand for justice even as his hatred for Biafra remains.

Opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. I say good evening to some of you, as I welcome you, I want you to welcome others. 3. My people in Akwa-Ibom they say ""Abasi mbong"" our people in urhobo say Tamuno. 4. I want you to pay attention to what I have to say this evening. 5. You have heard this clip before very many years ago and I want you to hear what this JANJAWEED has to say. 6. I want to prove all beyond every reasonable doubt that Fulani is the problem. 7. As I play this audio, somebody should put it on my page, that the world will know that Fulani never meant Nigeria to work from day one. 8. Buhari was following the footsteps of sardauna of Sokoto. 9. What this man said since 1950 is still active in our life today. 10. I am going to play the voice of this man again so that you can understand that this whole thing was planned years ago. 11. I want Wike, I want Ozodimgba to listen to me very well. 12. What APC is carrying out today was laid down before 1960. 13. Britain knew that Fulani hated igbo people because Britain hated igbo people. Why Britain hated igbo people is beyond me. 14. The North hates the east, they love the yoruba a little bit. that's why they said they are not leaving. 15. What is this hate or hatred for the Igbo? what has the igbos done? 16. Tribal tension has been there before the 60's and am asking people when will this tension stop? 17. A white man is asking a black baboon from Africa why do you hate a black man like you. 18. I want to prove to efulefus in the Zoo how the hatred in the Zoo today was brought. 19. Igbo people are ancient people ""ndi gboo"" that is why the are occupying the centre of the world. 20. Biafra is beyond what man can understand. 21. How did they dominate you, because everywhere they go to even a white man will ask them to run their work. 22. When you hear other tribe joining them to castigated Biafra don't blame them, anybody who is castigating Biafra will not make heaven. 23. This happened in the late 40's and Buhari has replicated the same northernisation and fulanisation. 24. Now let me prove it to you that what this man is saying over 60 years ago is still active today. 25. I have given you the first Fulani Gordy agenda of Fulanisation headed by Amadu Bello a reprobate. 26. The daughter of Abba Kyari is the one controlling the whole money of the Zoo and all of you are there shouting one Nigeria like mad people. 27. How God sent the unknown gun men we don't know but we are praying for them. 28. Let me remind some of you fools like Hope Uzodima. He said we hijacked ESN. 29. Hope Uzodima don't you wear Pampers and your fellow men are busy destroying you. 30. When they invite you to Sokoto that night you start sweating because you know what they will do you in the night. 31. NO MORE FUND RAISING IN THE ZOO, YOU ARE SOLDIERS YOU STAY IN THE BUSH UNTIL YOU ARE REFILLED . 32. On this note we have come to the end of this programme. Here on Radio Biafra is where we worship and Chukwu Okike Abiama is our God. From me from here is Good evening.

We are going to preach without prejudice. I will start this evening by dissecting the stupidity of an Igbo man. Do you want me to beg you, so you can defend your land?. Are you not foolish?. 2. We had a whole year to plan the war, until the war came, we start running around, five Million souls already layed dead. Same thing is happening now. 3. People are not cooperating, that is why only five thousand (5000), European men took over Africa. 4. Nzeogwu, Ironsi, and Azikiwe, they were all born in the feudal North, and fought for one Nigeria. 5. People don't want to associate with Arochukwu because of slavery, this is one of the reasons why God is angry with us. 6. Most of the settlements in Ikwerre are people sold into slaves and they were their till the end of slavery. 7. God anger have been with us for a long time. 8. Due to our individualism, we are where we are today. It is a very sober broadcast this evening. 9. They have tested their first Bomb in Imo State, two persons died. You know they installed their boy Hope Uzodimma there. 10. We are the miscreants but those who are doing the killings, Nnia Nwodo exonerated them. 11. Five million people died because there was no plan, the same thing that happened then is happening now, fifty solid years, Igbos have learnt nothing only claiming intellectuals. 12. A white man have shame, honour and integrity, black man have none that is the difference between a white man and a black man. 13. I begged you to donate one dollar each in Los Angeles, somebody asked why, I said it is because we need to prepare. Did you do it?. They were thinking if all of us contribute dollar each, Nnamdi Kanu will have millions now. Now Fulanis' are in your place. 14. Most of you in America are not spiritual, if you are you will know why Elohim sent you to America. 15. The love you have for your nation is the greatest love and your willingness to sacrifice to keep your nation progressing, not like the zoo. 16. Fulani Janjaweed went as far as Madagascar to bring drugs. 17. Every blessed day, Fulani Janjaweed is telling you, showing you they hate you. 18. Elohim will give us Biafra, what we will do to you people in America, the world will wonder, I say my thing laud and clear so that your envy will increase. 19. In 1967 we lost five million souls and in the year 2020, you are still doing the same thing. 20. Let me see anyone that say he is contesting for election, then you will buy rice and beans, today those you want to vote for you have their lives under threat and you can't do no anything 21. Every four years, they come out and ask you to vote for us and they will later stall whoever they like in Abuja. 22. I wonder what our ancestors will be thinking of you people right now. Serve your people and you are asking what you are going to gain. 23. In 2009 I told those in the north one day they will kill you and you will abandon all your properties. 24. Fulani hates you because Nzeogwu killed Ahamdu Bello. Nzeogwu was trying to save Nigeria. 25. Elohim please give us Biafra so we can set example with those stingy bastard in America. 26. They cannot learn from Kosovo and Armenia. 27. We are fighting for our freedom at the most difficult time, where there is no trust, the little trust left was destroyed by Uwazuruike. 28. Defending our land is a collective effort. You want me to beg you before you can rise up and defend your land. When George Washington was fighting for America, did he have to beg people to join?. That is the America you are enjoying. 29. There will be no movement on 30th May, atleast till its noon. 30. If you truly believe in something, I don't think anything anybody say will make you change your stand. 31. Our goal is simply to get Biafra. 32. You cannot see a Christian or Muslim renouncing their faith. People don't know that Biafra is a religion. 33. You said somebody insulted you and because of that you cannot fight for Biafra again but Almajiri have been in your village killing since 1945. Peter was crucified upside down in Rome, did it stop them?. 34. Once you defend them on the ground, Britain will give them aircraft to bomb you, we need weapons that can get down their aircrafts. 35. Any day they start killing and you retaliate, you will see them bombing your homes. 36. As we speak, Kaduna Christians are being massacred, the news broke out this evening. 37. Indigenous Christian communities in Southerner Kaduna, Seven [7] local government Area are being slaughtered. 38. An Igbo man in America is praying that the Fulanis' will come and kill us so he will come back and take the land belonging to the uncles wife. 39. There are Fulani native doctors in Ogbunike. Traitors in Ogbunike because of Money sold out (truncated)",http://www.thebiafrapost.com/2020/05/biafra-extracts-from-mazi-nnamdi-kanus_25.html,,,The Biafra Post: Biafra: Extracts From Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's Broadcast Of 24th May 2020 Via Radio Biafra,xxxxx,,,,14,0.74

But nothing happened till the next day. Those trapped under the collapsed building were all left to die. I tell you that you have no government. You have men who will always go to Abuja to get allocations they will squander. The fire service vehicle from Anambra can't dispatch its water. People have to help out with buckets. The same thing happened when thank explosion happened in Upper Iweka. It has always been Asaba to the rescue. If you are comfortable with these useless governments in Nigeria, then you must be an accomplice or gullible. You are at the mercy of God. It is zero protection from your government. That's why you will always die due to bad roads and say that's how God wants it. Do you mean to say that it is God that is killing you and not your wicked government? I doubt if some of us understand the reason for having a government. The government must make life easy for you, but here they loot you, deny you infrastructure and when you complain, they open fire on you as they did at Lekki Tollgate. Or they kidnap you and dump you in the DSS dungeon. Nigeria has been destroyed by her leaders. Things have become so bad that they can't be reversed. It is a vast land housing lots of different people. People of different ideologies and cultures. People that so hate themselves to the extent that they kill themselves. Yet some people are telling you that they will rescue Nigeria. When are you going to stand firm against these criminals masquerading as leaders? When?

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I don't believe in the ZOO called Nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he said. I LOVE JESUS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man? 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine? 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37.

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR RADIO AND BIAFRA TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Baifran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35. Things are now happening in ZOO and I thank Chukwu Okike Abiama for that. 36. People that kept your name away from the people that suffered Genocide, are they going to love you ? 37. Ask yourself why did Britian swore that Biafra will not arise, they said over their dead bodies and that is why Britain will be divided. 38. I commend the Oduduwa agitators for coming out today to campaign in London. 39. In this era of Big brother, the indomie people forget so easily. 40.

While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem. Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.” He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then. He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote. But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari! Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines. This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t known of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari. Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",https://www.facebook.com/ThePeriscopeGlobal/photos/a.1270974776370438/2288713264596579/?type=3,,,,,,,,12,-4.58

As if their old father or grandfather can do better. All the talk of instilling confidence and hope was forgotten. All the talk of giving us a direction in these perilous times was shunted aside. You say he is old and you want him to speak like you. You say he is illiterate, lifeless and has a dead brain and you still want him to give you direction. You say you don't recognize him as your President and you can't let him be to do what those that recognize him as the President elected him to do pending when your President finishes coming.

Until then it will be a crying shame if other countries are trying to get their act together while we're busy proving woke over an old man's pronounciation. Or refusing to adhere to simple public health safety directives such as social distancing and personal hygiene. This is not a political post. This is a call to action, a wake-up call, a passionate plea for concerted effort against a clear and present danger. This is saying enough of the frivolities. COVID-19 does not recognize APC, PDP, APGA, CAN, MURIC, Arewa Consultative Forum, Afenifere, Ohaneze, IPOB or BH. It is everyone's enemy.

The smell of cessation has gotten into the air and is in the background. Somehow, millions of Nigerians seem jittery on this subject. If there is one resolution firmly imbedded in their minds, it is that they will not allow their country to be broken into many fragments. The obidient movement is now in full blast and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the proponents of Oduduwa Republic (Yoruba Nation) are dipping their fingers in it, to the great irritation of diverse groups of patriotic citizens. The victory of IPOB's presidential candidate will be a victory for a disintegrated Nigeria. The Cyber warfare they are now waging on everyone that does not support their presidential candidate and on those that have opinions that differ from theirs, is a dress rehearsal for the greater conflict in which they will enmesh Nigeria and which will be inevitable should their candidate wins next year's presidential election. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu should exploit every vote-getting device to get himself elected as president, and since there is a stern resistance from patriotic citizens to the disintegration of nigeria, he should choose the unity of Nigeria as the theme of his first formal address in the campaign of the 2023 presidential election that is bid to begin on 28 of September this year, exactly a month away. He should tell the Nigerian masses that he is more concerned and less cheerful about the prospect of having an IPOB stooge as the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria than about becoming president himself. This will be saying plainly that he places the interest of Nigeria above his personal interest. He must tell the Nigerian electorate to shun political decision which might jeopardize the unity of their country. The good people of Nigeria must avoid connection with the political activities of IPOB, Yoruba Nation agitators, and the obidient movement. To boost their morale and alley their fears, Tinubu should tell Nigerians that our country is not going to be one united and indivisible Nigeria except insofar as we do not allow cessationist groups like IPOB to have their way in imposing their candidate on us as president of Nigeria. He should warn that so long as IPOB members that clearly hate Nigeria that they called a zoo, are allowed to vote and have their way in choosing our next president, there will be some danger that they will declare a Biafran republic, and even a nation which ardently desires peace may be drawn into yet another civil war that will be even more bloody and more devastating in effects than the one fought between 1967 and 1970. I am supporting Tinubu and I want him to be president because I hate the idea of a divided Nigeria. I know for sure that he had passed unnumbered hours, and he shall continue to pass unnumbered hours thinking and planning how Biafran agitation can be extirpated from this nation without war and without strife. The Nigerian electorate have to give him certain authority to provide safeguards of Nigerian unity and indivisibility. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has to be given a presidential mandate to maintain not only our territorial integrity but also our unity and peace, safety and progress. A word, they say, is enough for the wise. Whether we want a divided Nigeria or stay as one united Nigeria will depend on who will emerge as president during next year's presidential election. Nevertheless, I still reinterate with staccato emphasis on every word I utter, and I am speaking from long experience— that the effective maintenance of Nigeria's unity depends today as in the past on the wisdom of Nigerian voters to vote rightly on one hand, and on the determination of whoever will occupy the office of president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria next year to keep Nigeria as one nation. And Tinubu has that determination. Nothing can be clearer. At the moment, three major contestants are vying for the nation's presidency and most of the supporters of one of them are flirting with disintegration of the country. If they have their way, strifes might break. It might spread over Nigeria as the previous civil war did, which started in Enugu and then engulfed the entire country. I am saying, as plainly as words could say it, that if Nigerians want their country to break up, they can vote for the endorsed candidate of IPOB as president. But if they want one indivisible country, then Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is their man. And, of course, the final implication is that the great chance of the Nigerian people to avoid the grave possibility of a Biafran stooge emerging as president is to come out en masse to declare their support for Tinubu and say they want him as president irrespective of who he chooses as his running mate.",https://www.facebook.com/ncrmcomments/photos/a.1038412329506232/6062918453722236/?type=3,,,,,,,,12,-7.5

They are always dub-ious and have the resources to carry out any project. Be it bad or good. Do you remember Don Wanny of Omoku Rivers State? He was friend of politicians. They used him to commit many dirty things as to win elections. But when they are done, they hunted him down to Enugu and killed him for something they got no evidence that he committed. They didn't stop there. They also went after his brother and killed him in cold blood in front of his children. The government is facing IPOB now. Lots of things are going on. Mr Ekpa works for this politicians. His job is to use his dubious charismatic way to fool some IPOB followers, then recruit some crimiinals who will do the dirty job for him. The government will be far behind giving him the required resources. There are some people on ground that are ready to do anything provided money is involved. There are also some emotional fools that embraced the struggle. These guys are so emotional that they lack reasoning and tact. They are ready to work for Mr Ekpa because they think and believe the zoo needs to be taught a lesson. They mistake teaching the zoo a lesson with terro-rising their own people. They will aid the destruction of the same struggle they so much cherished. The aim of recruiting Mr Ekpa by the government is to help make the people hate the movement. The greatest problem facing Nigeria government is the fact that almost 90% of Ndị Igbo are pro IPOB. This needs to be punctured. And how can this be done. By terro-rizing the people in the name of freedom, IPOB and Biafra. There is a limit to what the people can take. The story of freedom is always beautiful, but the journey is always painful. Remember the Israelites on their way out of Egypt? They all were happy to leave Egypt at first, but on the way they faced difficulties and murmured against God and Moses. They wished to go back to Egypt and suffer than face what they are presently facing in the name of going to the promise land. Nigeria government desperately need the people of Biafra to turn against this very struggle and that is the job of Mr Ekpa. They will continue to terro-rize the people to the extent that the people will rise up against their own freedom. Don't forget that many are not registered IPOB members but they are fully in support of IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Imagine a situation where Mr Ekpa's gangs on ground starts terro-rising them that they start working against the struggle. This will Isolate the registered members to the extent that they will go underground or even denounce their struggle. Remember that many hard cores are already struggling. Some lost their jobs and many are on the run, changing from state to state. Soon we won't be only running from the wicked government agents, but from our dear brothers, no thanks to Mr Ekpa. They will even go after those writing for IPOB that are on ground. The worse thing is that those Mr Ekpa is using will be flushed out by the government like they did to Don Wanny immediately they achieve their purpose. And Mr Ekpa who is a citizen of another country will forever live happily with the money paid to him. Do you understand what I am saying? I don't really know why I am still writing and risking my safety for those that are not listening. The moment we started fighting the leadership of IPOB and command and control was the time we started endangering our lives and the life of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Don't forget that the master said he won't disappoint you, but you will disappoint him. He also turned around to tell someone not to allow Satan enter him. I will end it here. They will try, but they won't see us. And most importantly, they will fail.

At first, Nnamdi Kanu renders powerful prayer in the language of heaven (Igbo). 2. We do not worship any idol, we do not worship any graven image, we bow to nothing that the eye can see because you are a spirit. IPOB is your creation and not created by any man alive. 3. It is like a chess game we are playing, it doesn't matter what you do, capturing the King is important, we went for Aso Rock and we are crumbling the zoo. 4. I told them Chukwu Okike Abiama said I will destroy the zoo, I will not fire one gunshot but the zoo will fall and now the zoo has crumbled. 5. Tell our people in the Northern part of the failed Nigeria to organize themselves cos we are going home. 6. Any proclamation, any utterance and decree I made here must come to pass. Anything I said has come to pass, I don't possess any power but Elohim said anything I say here is behind heaven's instruction. 7. I have no car, I have no home, I have nothing and nothing matters to me now because my aim is Biafra and nothing will stand in my way. 8. When my parents died from the complications of the attack on my home, rather than become upset, it occured to me that the promise heaven made to me that anytime I sit behind this microphone and speak a word, that it will come to pass. I have continuously repeated here that I will sacrifice anything sacrificiable to see Biafra restored. I knew I had to lose something as supreme sacrifice for Biafra to come. 9. In the book of Judges Chapter 12. Jeptha was a Judge in Israel. He made a vow before he went to war, he said he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house once he comes back from war, he went to war and on returning, the first person that came out was his one and only daughter. Because he has made a promise to heaven. He did it. 10. God in heaven knows I don't hate anybody, I want everybody to free. From the lowest Almajiri to the Yorubas in the west, to the suffering Tivs and Jukuns in the Middle Belt, I want everybody to be free in the land of their ancestors. That even if we want to have a country that everybody will come together, willingly, voluntarily to join the union not by force and that is about to come to fruition. 11. Now I am certain that now that the head of the serpent (Abba Kyria) has been cut off. The zoo has collapsed completely like a pack of cards. 12. The Yorubas know that Buhari is dead, out of cowardice and fear, they kept supporting evil, they see the truth and they suppress it. We have such efulefus in Biafra land but we overcome them through our consistency. 13. Abba Kyria was evil that anybody who speaks good of Abba Kyria is evil. Abba Kyria was the one who sent Python Dance 1 to 4 to Biafra Land. He is ten times worse than Abacha. He was a kleptomaniac. When you stand on the side of the truth, you must remain resolutely consistent, to not move, do not waiver, do not shake. 14. Abba Kyria died on the 2nd day of April, we announced it, they were busy running around to get a mask for Abba Kyria instead of telling the people the truth. 15. Abba Kyria embezzled #13.5 billion naira meant for Aso Rock Clinic. Himself and his family took over NNPC as their family business. 16. There is nobody more corrupt than Magu the EFCC Chairman. He keeps money for Abba Kyria. 17. I keep going back to what I said before, Yoruba have not learnt anything from what happened to them before, they do not know history. 18. The message I have for them, my Yoruba brothers is that their blind envy and unfounded hatred against Biafra will ruin them. 19. Who are the people paying taxes in Lagos?. Who are the people importing goods in Lagos?. Who runs the economy of the zoo?. Are they not Biafrans?. When the MKO Abiola crises broke out and Biafrans left Lagos, was there still anything going on in Lagos. 20. Yorubas should find some people else to hate and not Biafrans, Fulanis took away Ilorin from them not Biafrans. Your duplicity as Aso Rock is crumbling, Yoruba media must be held responsible. 21. You think if you support evil, I will support you?. It is impossible for I will be destroyed by God any day I support evil. 22. Some of you may not remember that I told the whole world that everything Biafrans were forced to endure during the war that Nigeria will experience and suffer from it. When I said it, it sounded ridiculous and unbelievable but eventually and without fear it comes to pass before our very eyes. 23. We do not go to Yoruba land to kill them rather we go there and develop their land. Burning down our houses and shops makes no difference because whoever that is blessed by heaven cannot be cursed by man. If you burn one shop, you will see three spring up. The whole world tried it with Israel, they kept trying eventually Israel prevailed. 24. Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on the run now. 25. I do not need to (truncated)",,,,,,,,,10,-5.9

As is the tradition of Biafrans, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu renders supplicating prayers to heaven. 2. What you are witnessing now is the complete collapse of the zoo called Nigeria, it is absolute and nothing but absolute. 3. Sometimes ago, a prophet (Pastor Iginla) informed that Biafra is a spirit. I keep telling you, ihe anyi na eme bu ihe mmuo.(what we are doing is spiritual). 4. Referendum you said NO, restructure you said NO, Now Nigeria have fallen. 5. The most powerful man in the world is Trump, the most powerful throne in the world is America seat of power. You can insult him anyhow you like. In Nigeria they are jailing a 70year old man for insulting the dead Buhari. 6. Anytime I ask where is Osibanjo, they do the same thing they did when Buhari died, Photoshop and nothing more. 7. I struck the zoo in my father's compound in 2017 with only one bullet of truth, and today they have collapsed. 8. We are surgically dismantling the zoo. We are bisecting the zoo. When I said I will destroy the zoo, they thought I was coming with airforce one and airforce two and the rest of them. But Chukwu Okike Abiama gave me only the truth. 9. We are going home once Corona virus is gone. Who is going to stop us when Corona virus is gone?. If they take us to Court, we will demand for Buhari presence and they cannot provide a dead man buried in faraway Saudi Arabia. 10. The person running Nigeria this very moment is Aisha Buhari. 11. We need people to come out and confess their sins before going to prison. What Aisha Buhari is doing now is worse treason than what his husband did in 1983. 12. What Aisha Buhari is doing now is a hanging offence in any civilized country. Nobody voted for her just like the late Abba kyari. 13. You went to school but failed to understand that a written constitution on a piece of paper, for it to have any relevance it needs to be enforceable as a guiding law, what they are saying with what Boss Mustapha is doing now is that Yemi Osibanjo is not the right person to be acting. 14. Aisha Buhari have you asked yourself the chaos that is going to ensue when all these evil is laid bare in the open?. 15. People can do anything they want these days with pictures and videos, it is irrelevant, people want to see, feel and touch Yemi Osibanjo. 16. The sooner Aisha Buhari comes out to hand herself to whoever that will put the handcuffs and take her down to prison, the better. 17. There is something I don't understand about our Yoruba brothers, is it that they hate their brother or afraid to ask about the whereabout of their brother?. 18. I am not an ethnic bigot, am only asking why is it that our learned people and senior advocates from Yoruba land are quiet? That's what am asking?. 19. This is the first time in my life am hearing of the Presidency running a country. The reason why all we hear is Presidency is because their is no President. Write it down, go back from Obasanjo's time till that of Jonathan and count out the number of time the word ""The Presidency"" was used. 20. Obasanjo came out and said I DEY KAMPE! to prove he is alive and running but today they are telling people to ignore IPOB for claiming Buhari is dead, why cant the just come out to prove he is alive?. 21. Aisha Buhari and co, your failure to tell the world of your husband's death is a coup against the people just like your husband did in 1983. 22. Write it down now, Osibanjo is in a very serious mess. I am telling you about him because it is an indication of the collapse of the state. There is a complete failure of governance. Do you see how the zoo collapsed?. 23. We are very very close, extremely close, where are they going to run to?. Corona virus is a pregnancy, birth must be given to something after Corona virus, only Corona virus is holding the zoo. 24. All it will take now for Nigeria to collapse is a simple March. Only Corona virus is holding them. Go and read of the very recent revolutions. Go and read. 25. It is an unpardonable sin to hide the death of a President and holding a hostage of the Vice President. 26. Obasanjo, Bola Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar, Aisha Buhari, Rochas Okoroawusa etc will all go to jail because they know about this sin and concealed it. 27. IPOB is like the black Mamba. A black Mamba will strike you only once and go somewhere and sit down and wait for you to die. I spilled the poison almost three years ago. 28. Today Somalia have a President and Vice President but Nigeria doesn't, Chukwu Okike Abiama told me he will destroy Nigeria for our sake and I told you back then. 29. You elected a President and a Vice President, and one Boss Mustapha an ordinary political appointee is the one leading government response team and you think all is well. 30. We will remain on this Buhari topic no matter the distraction because this is the key. 31.

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria? 3. I don't believe in the ZOO called Nigeria and I will never be 4. Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he said. I LOVE JESUS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man? 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine? 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU 36. They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 37.

Some will still hate you and run you down. This time have taught me better. That not all truly want a Biafra away from Nigeria. Let me tell you the truth. Many rich men both in government and markets in Igbo land don't want Biafra to come. Nigeria as a country give them chance to make huge illegal money. How can you expect a governor in Nigeria that can squander money for 8 years and nothing will happen to want Biafra to be restored. After the squandering, he will go on to win senatorial seat and continue the looting from there. What of a business man that goes to China to request for substandard goods? What of the fake producer of wine in our markets distributing cancer to our people and making huge amounts of money? What of the criminals on our roads masquerading as policemen? What of the immigration officers in our airports collecting 100 dollars from first time travelers? What of the rapists and killers of youths masquerading as Nigeria soldiers? These guys are money bags and they are all out to end this struggle. They have the money and they are doing their best to end it. Biafra is what Nigeria can't be. The duty of these people is to either end IPOB or hand it over to them so that Biafra can become more evil and useless than their Nigeria. These people have bought over criminals that subscribed to IPOB thinking they can make money from it. Some IPOB members thought what IPOB is doing is to end today's oppressors and become tomorrow's oppressors. This was how MASOB derailed. They gave themselves governors of localities and turned themselves gods. They started bullying and extorting money from our people. Their reputation killed and gradually they died a natural death. These dubi-ous men joined IPOB too. They were thinking that when Biafra is restored, they will just be given positions that will allow them to steal. They think when Biafra is restored, they will have the power to put up a decree that will end Christianity. Many of them with many selfish ends. A true freedom fighter must understand that the end game is freedom. He must be ready to be willing to restore Biafra and enthrone laws that will guide every body, and turn the Biafra leader into a people's servant. This is the Biafra of our dreams. Not a Biafra you behave any how, act anyhow and lord it over others. It is not a Biafra you turn yourself into a god simply because you won ordinary governorship election. The sponsors of the infiltrators are the dubi-ous politicians, corrupt businessmen and women. They have recruited criminals among us to try and destroy what we are doing. These criminals will always shout that they are standing on the truth, but can't be proud to say or mention that truth they are standing on. They cannever be proud of that truth. I tell you this day. You must not succumb to them. Anyone telling you to make peace with them is your enemy. No infiltrator or supporter of infiltrators is your comrade. You must see them as worse than the oppressors. You must rise up against them. IPOB must take record of all of them supporting this madness and send them packing. No infiltrator must be allowed into any position in IPOB. Not even the position of a floor member. By so doing, you are not only protecting the struggle, you are also protecting and safeguarding the lives of our people. Every genuine IPOB member should understand that it is you against these criminals. I tell you this always. A hungry man is not just someone that is not rich. Most rich people in Nigeria are actually hungry. You can be rich or poor and still be hungry. This is why Nigeria politicians upon all their riches are still looting. This is why they were able to buy over lots of them abroad, and they contacted some of them in the zoo and rendered them one or two help and they sold their conscience. We must be careful. We must protect this struggle from these criminals. They might hate you today, but they will soon be defeated. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be released. He will chastise those that became indiscipline. He will maintain the sack of all the dubi-ous infiltrators. He will not give room for what happened this time to happen again. And finally, those that stood strong to defend this struggle will be celebrated as heroes.

Very funny people. Boko Haram are bombing, while Fulani herdsmen are slaughtering, with the Federal government aiding them. Nigerians are not worried about these things. Do you know what they are worried about? They are worried about those that insult them, call them zoo animals and fools. They make countless posts calling out people for calling them exactly what they are, but won't make a post against the terror they are facing in the name governance. Tell me what this government haven't done to this people. The other day, I made a call with my airtel line, and after the call, a message came in. I have been charged so so so naira including VAT. Everything you do in today's Nigeria, you will be paying Nigeria government. Bank transactions and other things. Instead of custom to secure Nigeria, they have been converted to money making machine. Jamb brags on how much they make out of suffering children fighting to gain admission in Nigeria. Getting ordinary admission is now very difficult. While foreign countries are welcoming students every semester. Tell me what other name I should call an idiot if not an idiot. Tell me another word for a fool? You intellectuals always create a world that doesn't exist. The truth is that calling Nigeria a zoo is an insult to zoo. There is animal right. I have signed petition before for a Lion and a deer to be treated well. But here we have people who claim to be educated and sophisticated but far removed from reality. They are treated below animal level by their government in their own lands. They are insulted across the world. No one got respect for them. Educated fools and sophisticated morons. What have the Islamic Federal Republic Of Nigeria not done? What hate action have they not done? But when I speak you tell me how I am causing trouble and war. What is the definition of war if not the killing of people in their numbers? How many have Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen killed? The worse is that the Fulani herdsmen has taken their madness to Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Asaba and Abia, killing dozens. These things aren't act of war to you. You are not worried. But when I say that it is only in the zoo inhabited by fools that such can happen, you brand me an insulting young man. Bro, I am simply saying the truth. Islam is gradually coming. Not only that rich Islamic countries sponsor them, they also control your land and resources. You don't know that the aspiration of every Muslim in Northern Nigeria is to see that every man and woman in Nigeria becomes Muslim. And they are working towards it. They don't care about development and growth. Convert to Islam and get appointment and contracts. Answer Islamic names and get favorable treatment. Your many brothers in the North has two names. One is a Muslim name they are using to work. That's your one Nigeria. Sell your people and get elevated into politics. Have you asked yourselves how you got sellouts as leaders in politics? Have you asked? They are all enthroned by the Fulani. That's exactly why they sacked Gov Emeka Ihedioha and replaced him with their stooge. Emeka Ihedioha wouldn't have succumbed to them. Remember that it was given to them as mandate not to allow you have control over your destiny. Allowing you to have real Igbo leaders will make them lose their hold on you. They can't risk it in Imo state. That's why they had to bring in Hope Uzodimma from a distant fourth, and made him governor, against the wishes of the people. Hope will definitely be loyal to those that made him. Exactly why he kept praising Brutai and Buhari. They are his masters. As far as am concern, the PEOPLE of Imo state have been cheated. I will call the persons that cheated them criminals and those that support such impunity fools and idiots. Deal with it. Elochukwu Ohagi, 2020.",,,,,,,,,9,-4.78

Where is the Referendum Agreement Nnamdi Kanu signed with Nigeria on the 15th February 2019 that made him ask Biafrans to go and vote on the 16th after asking them to destroy their voters card?

Why do Biafrans use Northern names in order to get Visa to travel abroad, are their names forbidden in the Embassies? Has Trump stormed Nigeria to Declare Biafra and make Nnamdi Kanu the Commander in Chief of Biafran Armed Forces?

Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he has I LOVE JESUS AND IM PROUD TO SAY IT 5. Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 6. Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man 7. Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 8. We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy 9. Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day 10. I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today 11. I.G.B.O is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 12. We have suffered, the pain is unbearable , the igbo is a very very stubborn race , to get where we are today was never easy 13. The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us Previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west 14. But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support him 15. The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free 16. Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN 17. As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 18. I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger , and today they are here 19. I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the person responsible for the mayhem in nigeria 20. I want the world to hear from us very very attentively, because what we are telling you is the truth 21. Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested , the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra 22. You have a band of Terrorist as thr so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previ to some Intel is telling you 23. Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah 24. Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them 25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 26. A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers , but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for you 27. I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 28. I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother , how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm , please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do ? 29. It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed , that is when they realised that it is game over 30. Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 31. A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school , did yoruba media cover it ? 32. Now listen to me very carefully, having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah 33. Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47 34. Some of the bandits even come onto the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine 35. LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!!

Opening prayer by the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Okwu Kanu. 2. I am the leader of the largest massive movement on this earth, I am the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, I am Nnamdi Kanu. 3. Tonight we are being listened to everywhere around the world, both on Ipob community Radio, Facebook, CHK and other various platforms. 4. I am going to play what this preacher said, please get your pen and paper radio, if you don't get your pen and paper Radio, you are doing yourself a harm. 5. They learnt from us, we thought them how to protest. Those who said that protest cannot yield anything today they are on the street protesting. 6. Everyday we are being vindicated, the whole world have begin to understand that we have always been right. 7. The education system you have there was only meant for you to remember and not to think. 8. It takes the wise to understand the damage they have done to you. 9. I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business.

Recall that on Tuesday, I reported the deletion of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) initiator’s account, amid the controversy surrounding the operation of ESN in the Southeast. In response to a mailed in inquiry to Facebook on Thursday, a spokesperson for the social media giant said Kanu’s page was removed for violating the Community’s guidelines. “We believe in giving people a voice, but we also want everyone using Facebook to feel safe. It’s why we have Community Standards, which set out what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook, and we remove anything that violates them,” the spokesperson said. “In line with our rules, we removed Nnamdi Kanu’s page for repeatedly posting content that breaks those Community Standards, including content that violated our rules on coordinating harm and hate speech,” Facebook added in the mail. The deletion of Nnamdi Kanu’s Facebook account came days after the IPOB leader posted a video showing the eviction of killer herdsmen from Southeast forests and killing of cows owned by Fulani herders by the ESN. Spokesman for the IPOB, Emma Powerful could not be reached for comment. But in a backup account allegedly owned by Kanu, the IPOB leader alleged that the Nigerian government paid Facebook to pull down his page. “The zoo(a term he uses to address Nigeria) have payed(sic) Facebook to delete my the other page, but we are unstoppable, We are the great children’s of chukwu okikeabiama, the zoo is gone forever, #wemove,” he wrote. Checks on Thursday afternoon shows that Kanu’s Facebook account, which he uses to front his Biafra agitation and some times issue order to ESN, was still ‘down’ 48 hours later. This is not the first time that Facebook is pulling down accounts belonging to top political figures and activists across the globe over alleged violation of their Community’s guidelines. In January, the social media giant suspended the official account of former United States president Donald Trump over persistent posts alleging election fraud and for allegedly calling for violence in the U.S. Capitol. The deletion of Nnamdi Kanu’s official Facebook account has been met with mixed reaction with many users alleging a clampdown on dissenting voices and infringement on people’s rights to freedom of speech.",https://www.facebook.com/biafraisours/photos/a.3423486421013131/4181398525221913/?type=3,,,,,,,,8,-7.38

They are always dub-ious and have the resources to carry out any project. Be it bad or good. Do you remember Don Wanny of Omoku Rivers State? He was friend of politicians. They used him to commit many dirty things as to win elections. But when they are done, they hunted him down to Enugu and killed him for something they got no evidence that he committed. They didn't stop there. They also went after his brother and killed him in cold blood in front of his children. The government is facing IPOB now. Lots of things are going on. Mr Ekpa works for this politicians. His job is to use his dubious charismatic way to fool some IPOB followers, then recruit some crimiinals who will do the dirty job for him. The government will be far behind giving him the required resources. There are some people on ground that are ready to do anything provided money is involved. There are also some emotional fools that embraced the struggle. These guys are so emotional that they lack reasoning and tact. They are ready to work for Mr Ekpa because they think and believe the zoo needs to be taught a lesson. They mistake teaching the zoo a lesson with terro-rising their own people. They will aid the destruction of the same struggle they so much cherished. The aim of recruiting Mr Ekpa by the government is to help make the people hate the movement. The greatest problem facing Nigeria government is the fact that almost 90% of Ndị Igbo are pro IPOB. This needs to be punctured. And how can this be done. By terro-rizing the people in the name of freedom, IPOB and Biafra. There is a limit to what the people can take. The story of freedom is always beautiful, but the journey is always painful. Remember the Israelites on their way out of Egypt? They all were happy to leave Egypt at first, but on the way they faced difficulties and murmured against God and Moses. They wished to go back to Egypt and suffer than face what they are presently facing in the name of going to the promise land. Nigeria government desperately need the people of Biafra to turn against this very struggle and that is the job of Mr Ekpa. They will continue to terro-rize the people to the extent that the people will rise up against their own freedom. Don't forget that many are not registered IPOB members but they are fully in support of IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Imagine a situation where Mr Ekpa's gangs on ground starts terro-rising them that they start working against the struggle. This will Isolate the registered members to the extent that they will go underground or even denounce their struggle. Remember that many hard cores are already struggling. Some lost their jobs and many are on the run, changing from state to state. Soon we won't be only running from the wicked government agents, but from our dear brothers, no thanks to Mr Ekpa. They will even go after those writing for IPOB that are on ground. The worse thing is that those Mr Ekpa is using will be flushed out by the government like they did to Don Wanny immediately they achieve their purpose. And Mr Ekpa who is a citizen of another country will forever live happily with the money paid to him. Do you understand what I am saying? I don't really know why I am still writing and risking my safety for those that are not listening. The moment we started fighting the leadership of IPOB and command and control was the time we started endangering our lives and the life of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Don't forget that the master said he won't disappoint you, but you will disappoint him. He also turned around to tell someone not to allow Satan enter him. I will end it here. They will try, but they won't see us. And most importantly, they will fail.

After the squandering, he will go on to win senatorial seat and continue the looting from there. What of a business man that goes to China to request for substandard goods? What of the fake producer of wine in our markets distributing cancer to our people and making huge amounts of money? What of the criminals on our roads masquerading as policemen? What of the immigration officers in our airports collecting 100 dollars from first time travelers? What of the rapists and killers of youths masquerading as Nigeria soldiers? These guys are money bags and they are all out to end this struggle. They have the money and they are doing their best to end it. Biafra is what Nigeria can't be. The duty of these people is to either end IPOB or hand it over to them so that Biafra can become more evil and useless than their Nigeria. These people have bought over criminals that subscribed to IPOB thinking they can make money from it. Some IPOB members thought what IPOB is doing is to end today's oppressors and become tomorrow's oppressors. This was how MASOB derailed. They gave themselves governors of localities and turned themselves gods. They started bullying and extorting money from our people. Their reputation killed and gradually they died a natural death. These dubi-ous men joined IPOB too. They were thinking that when Biafra is restored, they will just be given positions that will allow them to steal. They think when Biafra is restored, they will have the power to put up a decree that will end Christianity. Many of them with many selfish ends. A true freedom fighter must understand that the end game is freedom. He must be ready to be willing to restore Biafra and enthrone laws that will guide every body, and turn the Biafra leader into a people's servant. This is the Biafra of our dreams. Not a Biafra you behave any how, act anyhow and lord it over others. It is not a Biafra you turn yourself into a god simply because you won ordinary governorship election. The sponsors of the infiltrators are the dubi-ous politicians, corrupt businessmen and women. They have recruited criminals among us to try and destroy what we are doing. These criminals will always shout that they are standing on the truth, but can't be proud to say or mention that truth they are standing on. They cannever be proud of that truth. I tell you this day. You must not succumb to them. Anyone telling you to make peace with them is your enemy. No infiltrator or supporter of infiltrators is your comrade. You must see them as worse than the oppressors. You must rise up against them. IPOB must take record of all of them supporting this madness and send them packing. No infiltrator must be allowed into any position in IPOB. Not even the position of a floor member. By so doing, you are not only protecting the struggle, you are also protecting and safeguarding the lives of our people. Every genuine IPOB member should understand that it is you against these criminals. I tell you this always. A hungry man is not just someone that is not rich. Most rich people in Nigeria are actually hungry. You can be rich or poor and still be hungry. This is why Nigeria politicians upon all their riches are still looting. This is why they were able to buy over lots of them abroad, and they contacted some of them in the zoo and rendered them one or two help and they sold their conscience. We must be careful. We must protect this struggle from these criminals. They might hate you today, but they will soon be defeated. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be released. He will chastise those that became indiscipline. He will maintain the sack of all the dubi-ous infiltrators. He will not give room for what happened this time to happen again. And finally, those that stood strong to defend this struggle will be celebrated as heroes.

FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF RADIO BIAFRA Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. Opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. Mark today's date, today is the 11th of April 2021. I am going to catch Wike alive. (M'ga anwuta ya na aka). 3. Somebody can wake up in the morning and set up an order and ban a meeting. 4. The day madness will catch up with Wike, you will start talking about our madness and leave Wike. 5. I saw some article by Britain home-office, I don't give a damn. 5. For one Boko Haram, I will give you five. 6. Some people are saying tune it down, chineke kpo unu ọkụ. 7. All of you have abandoned what happened in Imo state and you are facing something different. 8. Our madness is coming, you have not seen nothing yet. 9. I was in Zoo court and I called Buhari a mad man. 10. Obasanjo, former president was holding a meeting with Shaikh Gumi. 11. Shaikh Abubakar Gumi the bandit envoy is the chief negotiator for the l so called presidency. 12. I have warned my Yoruba brothers, don't allow yourself to be used by this people. 13. When they first settles, the Yoruba journalist should be held accountable. 14. You thought you are doing IPOB and Biafra, but today Fulani are in your forest. 15. Why is it that when you write about Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram you don't use the word prescribed? But when you write about IPOB you use prescribed? 16. Only Biafra can save all of us. 17. How about that old traitor, Edwin Clark. An old African man answering a white man's name. 18. Shaikh Gumi, the same man that said Boko Haram is a blessing is now the peace maker between Boko haram and the Zoo. 19. That tells you that every security apparels in the Zoo is set to Islamise you. 20. I ask you animal that call yourself Nigerians, does it mean that your brain cannot put one and two together. 21. By the time I am done with these animals, their wives will not cook for them again. 22. How many times have you heard that their homes and towns in the north were attacked with gun boat and air bombardment, only in the south. 23. May the unknown gun men locate you. 24. Some of you animals in the Zoo does not even know what is the work of the army in the Zoo. 25. Let me educate all you Zoo animals. The duty of the army is to defend the borders of the country. 26. People wrote about it in the time of Jonathan that the Yorubas are marginalized, but right in front of you Fulani has maginalised you. 27. God almighty will bear me witness, the ZOO WILL FALL. 28. The same Fulani that hate the security Outfit is heading every terrorist outfit in the Zoo. 29. Dear Nigerians, when will this your Stupidity and idioticy leave your brain or where you born this way? 30. Once you say your a Nigeria you're an animal 31. I want the Fulani JANJAWEED to understand that what we are doing is backed up by Torah and Quran. 32. Aisha wrote and said ""I myself Aisha , I don't travel abroad for clinic because Aso Rock clinic is in good shape. 33. Then the idiot started writing to the king of Jordan that you are on vacation. 34. Why are you writing to the king of Jordan? Because Aisha caught you out. 35. Like Omokiri rightly said, "" does the queen of England come to the Zoo for trinity? 36. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOUR HOLY KORAN SAID IN SURA SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT ALLAH IS WITH IPOB AND BIAFRA ""SURA 42:1 ALL THOSE WHO FIGHT WHEN YOU ARE OPERSSING THEM THERE IS NO BLAME FOR THEM. GOD WILL PUNISH YOU ALL THE OPERESSORS. 37. Anything they say you jump, anything they ask you to do you do it , because you are under Fulani tyranny. 38. Fulani understands this, that among the victims of python dance, there is always one person that will rise up and say, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. 39. I told you there will be no road blocks on Biafra land and I am giving this order again tonight. ANYWHERE YOU SEE A ROAD BLOCK, OR ARMY CHECKPOINT DESTROY IT 40. IF YOUR SON, OR BROTHER IS AMONG THOSE WHO COMES OUT ON THE ROAD ALONG IHIEALA ROAD IF WE CATCH YOU , YOU WILL DIE !!! 41. Anywhere you see road block in our land DESTROY IT. 42. BBC IGBO, BBC IGBO!! ONE DAY YOU WILL HEAR IT. 43. Our crime in IPOB, is that defend our people. 44. Where were you all idiots when they came to my home to kill me. 45. That madness Fulani is looking for they will find and Britain will never save you. 46. If you don't rise up now Fulani will take over your land. 47. Yoruba listen to me, fulani have perfected a way to take over your land, your journalist is ashamed to talk about it, the same Shame has caught up with DAVE UMAHI. 48. When they accuse IPOB every newspaper will carry it, but when Boko haram kills or army kills then it is ""allegedly "" 49. EASTERN SECURITY NETWORK 10, 000 men under arms, these are those in the forest . 50. Mark my word, one day the Fulani will arise and they will kill all of you in the north and Biafra will come quick, then we will unleash our madness. 51.

The presidential spokesperson who lashed out at those he claimed do nothing but find faults in the country, cautioned Nigerians against ” disintegration, destabilization and outright war”. Adesina also admitted that the internecine conflict which came off the civil war, are still very evident in some parts of the land. He wrote; “It’s often intriguing to hear eminent and well appointed Nigerians talk about disintegration, destabilization and outright war, as if it’s a picnic. War? Not a tea party, and not something you should wish even upon your enemy. Nigeria fought a war before, in which about two million people died. There was sorrow, tears and blood, till good sense prevailed, and we said there was no victor, no vanquished. The scars of that internecine conflict are still very evident in some parts of the land. “Why then do some newspaper columnists, public commentators, ethnic warlords, even academics, talk of war as something they long for, an affliction they want to inflict their country with? War? Is it a picnic or tea party? “I have seen enough to make me conclude that the greatest problem of Nigeria are Nigerians themselves. They seem to hate their country. There was that atheist who said on his death bed. “I hate everybody. I hate God. I even hate myself.” That seems to be the experience of a good number of Nigerians. “What am I saying? Is Nigeria in a perfect state, nirvana, a Utopia? By no means. We all see things that exasperate us about our country. So, is cutting off the head the cure for headache? Is death wish for the country through the constant craving for war the way out, couched as warnings by some interest groups? For really, that is what they would wish to see, if only to have the morbid satisfaction of saying: we warned, they didn’t listen. “We have our grouses with Nigeria. The President often talks of missed opportunities, and yes, this country has missed many, over the decades. But he adds that those of them who have fought to keep this country together would never open their eyes and see Nigeria dismembered. Loving the unloveable. That is what Nigerians need, if we would eventually get the country we desire. William Cowper, English writer, who lived between 1731 and 1800, said: “England, with all thy faults, I love thee still-my country.” “That is one thing we find lacking. We have not got to the point that we can say, Nigeria, with all thy faults, I love thee still-my country. “The Good Book says love covers a multitude of sins. And it does. But does it happen in respect of our country? Don’t Nigerians carry around giant-sized grudges against themselves, against their leaders, against the next ethnic group, and against their own very land… They seem to hate their country. There was that atheist who said on his death bed. “I hate everybody. I hate God. I even hate myself. “The need of the hour is love for Nigeria, warts and all. Yes, there are many reasons not to love this land. But it’s the only one we have. We would be second class citizens anywhere else. Nigeria we hail thee. Our own dear native land. The fault lines are many: ethnicity, suspicion of domination, religious differences, language, centrifugal forces. But, Nigeria, with all thy faults, I love thee still-my country. “Do you know that some Nigerians actually gloat when things go wrong in the country? They rejoice at wanton killings, massive insecurity, prostrate economy, decrepit inter-ethnic relationships, and the like. They want things to fall apart in the ‘zoo.’ But Nigeria will survive. The singer, Veno Marioghae, said it long ago. Nigeria is like the testicles of a ram. It may sway from side to side as the ram runs, but it will never fall off. “It’s time we began to have a Nigerian agenda, instead of sectional agenda. It’s time we began to see the big picture, and wish our country well. Enough of wars and rumours of war. Can we cavil less about our country? Can we emphasize less on things not done, and focus more on things being achieved? And I tell you, the Buhari government has stories to tell. Of rice pyramids, roads, rail, bridges, airports, massive infrastructure everywhere. “Just on Thursday, the 13 Floor, Twin Tower ultra-modern Headquarters Building of the Niger Delta Development Commission was commissioned, about 26 years after it was conceived. And many of such projects abound. Let’s wail less, and appreciate more. Nigeria, with all thy faults, I love thee still-my country.”",https://www.facebook.com/ob360media/photos/a.768191709952904/3454414371330611/?type=3,,,Timeline photos,,,,,6,-5.5

Ndiokwere) PREAMBLE: WHO IS THE RIGHTEOUS ONE? Who is a saint? Who is without sin; let him throw the first stone! Most Religious people, including the Popes and canonized saints, great Educationists, Professors, great Inventors, Politicians and World leaders – living or alive - have never been known to be free of sin. Some are even known to have served prison sentences for various ‘crimes’ before they became world figures! Few Nigerian political and religious leaders, past and present, are known to be ‘saints’. Just a few, if any at all, who must have made notable contributions towards the welfare of their people still enjoy a comfortable place in history books! Can we award marks on ‘merit’ to the prominent few we still remember their names in the field of politics in Nigeria? Nnamdi Azikiwe – Zik of Africa, Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Saduana of Sokoto, Tafawa Balewa, Shehu Shagari, Goodluck Jonathan, Obasanjo (civilian) and Muhammadu Buhari (civilian)? Surely ALL OF THEM have/had big DENTS on their character, and surely just few Nigerians speak well of them. They have all big dents! I am sure if human beings can shun prejudices, and speak the truth, not one of the former and present Nigerian leaders may score up to 20% mark. On the State level – Eastern states, as an example: Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibiam, Ukpabi Asika? Jim Nwobodo, Orjiuzor Kalu, Theodore Orji, Samuel Onunaka Mbakwe? Ikedi Ohakim, Rochas Anayo Okorocha, Emeka Ihedioha, Hope Uzodimma - All have big terrible Dents. Perhaps only SAMUEL MBAKWE may score above 40%! History supplies verifiable facts and figures. MAZI NNAMDI KANU – THE FORMER ALLEGED ‘CROOK’ You may like MNK, hate him, agree with him, disagree; it is becoming clearer that History may at last identify the guy as an indomitable Black-African patriot and freedom fighter after Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela, among former ‘rebels’ who played a great role in the struggle for the liberation of their people from slavery and bondage. Those who hate Kanu, including his fellow Igbos, write all sorts of trash to discredit IPOB movement and their leader. Look at the type of stuff they write and circulate: “Nnamdi Kanu was once a scammer, 419-er, a fake”….! No problem. The big question: “What do these enemies of progress hope to achieve by this campaign of calumny? ‘Allegations’, True or False; that WAS in the past; ‘HE WAS…’, ‘MNK used to be….’ But today he is “Born-Again”, intelligent, sensible, and full of wisdom, and speaks the truth. He is alive today working for the freedom of his people. Why join your enemies to block your freedom and that of generations to come? GOOD LEADERS MAKE SACRIFICES Surely MNK has the largest followers among all Igbo leaders today, and these are not ‘idle useless mob’. However MNK may not be ‘Superhuman’ and without dent; but his case is surely that of a lone voice in the wilderness! What do you expect from his people! The Bible confirms that a prophet is not acknowledged in his own village, among his own people. What will MNK lose more in Nigeria, when the Cabal, aided by Igbo traitors tried to get rid of the young man in a Historical “Python Dance?” They massacred so many youths and as well brought about the untimely death of his parents. He escaped death because of the presence of some Biafran soldiers in Nigerian military. If I were MNK I will not give up this struggle, come what may. I will face death and join my dead parents where they are! But let posterity take records. MNK AND THE ZOO REPUBLIC Many ‘educated’ Nigerians do not like MNK primarily because of his ‘language’. But how can you blame the young man, when in a “Democratic country”: (1) The IDENTITY of the President has been under contention for over 3 years now? But I do not admire how the ‘investigation’ of this ‘mystery’, ‘allegation’ is going on! It should NOT be Nnamdi Kanu or any private journalist, foreign or local, who should tell the world the ‘Truth’ of the Matter. It is part of Nigerian History today that ABBA KYARI is dead and buried. Period! Documented, publicly and officially confirmed by “competent” government authorities. The historical records are in the archives. (2) The ‘allegation’ that Buhari is dead and buried in Saudi Arabia since 2017 sounds FUNNY! What should be the “very important reason/s” for Buhari family to hide the death of their father? In a matter of life and death event, is it a Political Party or Government in power that makes public the death of a family member? Is the reason for the Cabal to remain in power till the end of the world enough to frame a ‘conspiracy theory’ surrounding the identity of a Head of State, and to choose or CLONE a non- Nigerian from Sudan, and name him (Dead) Buhari? Does the Cabal need such irresponsible, stupid, ‘rigorous procedure or tactics’ to retain power?

10.  I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today

11.  IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 

12.  We have suffered,  the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy

13.  The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west

14.  But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support  him

15.  The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free

16.  Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN

17.  As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 

18.  I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 

19.  I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the  person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 

20.  I want the world to hear from us very very attentively,  because what we are telling you is the truth 

21.  Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra

23.  Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah

24.  Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them

25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 

26.  A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for  you

27.  I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 

28.  I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do?

29.  It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised  that it is game over

30.  Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 

31.  A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ?

32.  Now listen to me very carefully,  having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah

33.  Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47

I hope if you are listening via Facebook you know that Facebook is part and parcel of the Satanic enclave that suppresses the truth and does not want a black man to know the truth. 10. They need you in Africa to remain like a baboon, they need you not to remember what happened. 11. That is why I told you to download the IPOB COMMUNITY RADIO APP it is very cheap to listen to, we are also on YouTube. 12. You are waiting for a white man to cure every illness, you are waiting for them to produce areoplane, that is how your mind has been trained to remember and not to think. 13. Some of us don't have comon sense, some of us don't understand what is holding us down. 14. If what we are doing is not working, why are they talking about one Nigeria?. There is a deliberate to suppress what we are doing. 15. This is why Mark Zuggerbagger has been bribed to silence what we are doing. 16. If Biafra is not in the White House, why will Obama come out and begin to defend one Nigeria? 17. Ending SARS now is not the issue, you must end NIGERIA now. 18. The problem is not SARS, SARS is just the symptom. 19. They ended SARS because they are afraid of visa ban, so that they can travel to America. You see this SARS ban is the fourth times they have banned it, there is something dishonest about this government. 20. There is a headline I once posted by BBC Pidgin. Let me tell you what BBC reported. That the same man today who said he has banned SARS banned it last year. 21. I want our people to pay close attention, for those of you who are wondering, now listen to what IPOB and Radio Biafra has done. The various igbo group in the coastal region has said that they want to reclaim their identity. That is the power of consistency . 22. You cannot claim that you are Ohaneze ndi igbo and yet you allow your people to wallow in identity crisis . 23. People dont understand how much I hate nigeria. 24. The man who was responsible for adding this ""R"" to all this names to differentiate the names in the Riverine area was Melford Okilo, he was former governor of Rivers State. I went there to see him in London. 25. People should stop complaining like little children, go and download IPOB Community Radio. 26. If they tell you before in cross river state would you have agreed? They tried to cramp us into a small place. 27. That is why I hate Nigeria, people knows the truth yet they chose to believe the Liars. 28. When colonialism came, the white man came with a plan to colonize you forever. 29. Why was it not a crime to join people together but it is a crime for people to leave. 30. Do you see why blacks are wretched and are all animals, because they cannot reason. I ask God in heaven, is there any other way I have to explain this so that people can understand how foolish they are. 31. I want to ask Britain, you have so much in common with someone In Germany than I have with a Fulani. But you that have one thing in common wants to leave Europe. 32. Now let me explain something to you that people don't understand. We are going to respect every nationality when Biafra is restored. 33. In Rivers State, you have egbema and you also have the same in Imo state and yet Ohaneze did nothing about it . Now do you see why I don't like Ohaneze? 34. You see Lauretta Onochie, the spirit of harlotery entered that one and she is busy selling prostitutes here and there. 35. I have done my research, the only people around the world to have denied who they are, are the igbo people. 36. I am letting Vanguard to know that anyday they publish their news with a small dot saying that this is igbo, every of their vendors in Biafraland will be destroyed. 37. Biafra is made up of various clan and ethnic groups, and you want us to leave our people and go? You are not serious. 38. Nigeria is a business is not a country, is a mere British business. That is the ZOO for (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/100063566528076/videos/397656201246214/,,,Wonderful speach from my able leader,,,,,5,-0.55

Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened. 3. Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 5. Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man, ignorance, stupidity, jealousy, envy and greed. 6. It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 7. Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 8. I never wanted to preach this tonight, but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 9. They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea.

We are going to preach without prejudice. I will start this evening by dissecting the stupidity of an Igbo man. Do you want me to beg you, so you can defend your land?. Are you not foolish?. 2. We had a whole year to plan the war, until the war came, we start running around, five Million souls already layed dead. Same thing is happening now. 3. People are not cooperating, that is why only five thousand (5000), European men took over Africa. 4. Nzeogwu, Ironsi, and Azikiwe, they were all born in the feudal North, and fought for one Nigeria. 5. People don't want to associate with Arochukwu because of slavery, this is one of the reasons why God is angry with us. 6. Most of the settlements in Ikwerre are people sold into slaves and they were their till the end of slavery. 7. God anger have been with us for a long time. 8. Due to our individualism, we are where we are today. It is a very sober broadcast this evening. 9. They have tested their first Bomb in Imo State, two persons died. You know they installed their boy Hope Uzodimma there. 10. We are the miscreants but those who are doing the killings, Nnia Nwodo exonerated them. 11. Five million people died because there was no plan, the same thing that happened then is happening now, fifty solid years, Igbos have learnt nothing only claiming intellectuals. 12. A white man have shame, honour and integrity, black man have none that is the difference between a white man and a black man. 13. I begged you to donate one dollar each in Los Angeles, somebody asked why, I said it is because we need to prepare. Did you do it?. They were thinking if all of us contribute dollar each, Nnamdi Kanu will have millions now. Now Fulanis' are in your place. 14. Most of you in America are not spiritual, if you are you will know why Elohim sent you to America. 15. The love you have for your nation is the greatest love and your willingness to sacrifice to keep your nation progressing, not like the zoo. 16. Fulani Janjaweed went as far as Madagascar to bring drugs. 17. Every blessed day, Fulani Janjaweed is telling you, showing you they hate you. 18. Elohim will give us Biafra, what we will do to you people in America, the world will wonder, I say my thing laud and clear so that your envy will increase. 19. In 1967 we lost five million souls and in the year 2020, you are still doing the same thing. 20. Let me see anyone that say he is contesting for election, then you will buy rice and beans, today those you want to vote for you have their lives under threat and you can't do no anything 21. Every four years, they come out and ask you to vote for us and they will later stall whoever they like in Abuja. 22. I wonder what our ancestors will be thinking of you people right now. Serve your people and you are asking what you are going to gain. 23. In 2009 I told those in the north one day they will kill you and you will abandon all your properties. 24. Fulani hates you because Nzeogwu killed Ahamdu Bello. Nzeogwu was trying to save Nigeria. 25. Elohim please give us Biafra so we can set example with those stingy bastard in America. 26. They cannot learn from Kosovo and Armenia. 27. We are fighting for our freedom at the most difficult time, where there is no trust, the little trust left was destroyed by Uwazuruike. 28. Defending our land is a collective effort. You want me to beg you before you can rise up and defend your land. When George Washington was fighting for America, did he have to beg people to join?. That is the America you are enjoying. 29. There will be no movement on 30th May, atleast till its noon. 30. If you truly believe in something, I don't think anything anybody say will make you change your stand. 31. Our goal is simply to get Biafra. 32. You cannot see a Christian or Muslim renouncing their faith. People don't know that Biafra is a religion. 33. You said somebody insulted you and because of that you cannot fight for Biafra again but Almajiri have been in your village killing since 1945. Peter was crucified upside down in Rome, did it stop them?. 34. Once you defend them on the ground, Britain will give them aircraft to bomb you, we need weapons that can get down their aircrafts. 35. Any day they start killing and you retaliate, you will see them bombing your homes. 36. As we speak, Kaduna Christians are being massacred, the news broke out this evening. 37. Indigenous Christian communities in Southerner Kaduna, Seven [7] local government Area are being slaughtered. 38. An Igbo man in America is praying that the Fulanis' will come and kill us so he will come back and take the land belonging to the uncles wife. 39. There are Fulani native doctors in Ogbunike.

1.  Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 

2. Are you prepared to ask yourself this question, what is the course of the insecurity in Nigeria?

3.  I don't believe in the ZOO called Nigeria and I will never be

4.  Dont take my word for it, take the words of the governor of Benue state, I am going to play his voice now so that you will hear what he said. I LOVE JESUS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY IT 

5.  Facebook does not understand what we are saying, all they understand is let's live together as one Nigeria 

6.  Have you ever seen a Fulani man came out to criticize the killings by the Fulani man?

7.  Look at what is happening in Yorubaland they have  all rallied together to support the young man that is fighting the Fulani 

8.  We built an unmovable family in IPOB and that is my joy

9.  Allow me to speak about IPOB, this noble family, and that is why I pray for you seven times a day

10.  I want the world to understand the hurdles and obstacles IPOB has to overcome to get where we are today

11.  IGBO is the only people on this earth that will reject their identity 

12.  We have suffered,  the pain is unbearable,, the igbo is a very very stubborn race, to get where we are today was never easy

13.  The reason why our Yoruba brethren were attacking us previously is because they never had a Nnamdi Kanu in the west

14.  But as soon as they got their own Nnamdi Kanu they started to support  him

15.  The bible said, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free

16.  Remember i use to tell you, that at the end we always WIN

17.  As soon as Biafra comes some of you will move on and mine continues until Nigeria ceases to exist 

18.  I told you that Fulani is coming and they said I am a warmonger, and today they are here 

19.  I want to play the voice of a Nigerian governor, so that you may know the  person responsible for the mayhem in Nigeria 

20.  I want the world to hear from us very very attentively,  because what we are telling you is the truth 

21.  Ortom said Miyethi Alah must be arrested, the same Miyethi Alah that is working with Obiano in Anambra

22.  You have a band of Terrorist as the so called presidency, this is what a Governor who is previleged to some Intel is telling you 

23.  Who are those in your Presidency, Miyethi Alah, not IPOB but the Terrorist Miyethi Alah

24.  Fulani, even if they are killing you they bind together to protect one of them

25. But for you people, you will always deny yourself, it is called self hate 

26.  A whole president in the ZOO will come out and defend killers, but you people out of your jelousy will never defend those that are protecting and fighting for  you

27.  I can forgive everybody including satan but I will never forgive Yoruba media 

28.  I ask Facebook and all these oteletuals, somebody is in your farm raping your mother, how do I stop him from raping my mother in the farm? Please answer me how do I defend myself ? What do you expect me to do?

29.  It is Britain that is defending and protecting Fulani, that day they came to my house to kill me and they failed, that is when they realised  that it is game over

30.  Fulani moving cattle from place to place like a deranged lunatics, these are they people you gave your country ro run for you 

31.  A child was shot dead yesterday coming back from school, did yoruba media cover it ?

32.  Now listen to me very carefully,  having listened to Ortom, my question is, when will they arest the Miyethi Alah

33.  Shake Gumi went into the bushes to visit the killer bandits, they bandits, went into the meeting with with their AK47

34.  Some of the bandits even came to the meeting with their Ak47 can you imagine?

35.  LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR THIS NIGHT, EVERY BIAFRAN IN THE NORTH YOU BETTER COME BACK HOME!!! ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, IF YOU REMAIN IN THE NORTH THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU

36.   They take your crude to Equitorial Guinea and other countries, refine it there and bring it back to you, tell me any country that is more idiotic than the ZOO. 

37.  On that note we have come to the end of this broadcast, as always,  Biafra is our religion and on this platform Radio Biafra is where we worship, with all the love in me, from me, from here, it is Good evening

No man's land phrase of Lagos does not imply the abolishment of Indigenous people of Lagos rather the multiethnic population that Lagos enjoys which Onitsha, Nnewi, and Aba also should enjoy even more than Lagos but because of the Igbophobia in Nigeria this leverage and privilege were deprived from Igbos in Onitsha, Nnewi and Aba by systematically closing down every industries situated in Biafra land and closing down of every existing sea ports in Igbo land and Biafra land in general which consist of all former eastern Nigeria region Onitsha has been and are still a commercial city regards as the largest international market in the whole of west Africa since the colonial era before Lagos. For this facts and in the spirit of welcoming multiethnic population in their commercial hubs they nicknamed Anambra State Home for all . Home for all also means home for Yorubas, Hausa,, Fulani and other ethincities in the zoo and outside the zoo called Nigeria to welcome multiethnic population in their commercial city which Ndigbo built by themselves without any government assistance. and no Anambra man persie has made complaints that their home cannot be for all but for themselves. But wonder in Yoruba land where a man whose ancestral origin is from Osun state incite touts to go destroy properties they didn't build and confiscate lands they did not own or bought or have sold out to Ndigbo because Yoruba owns Lagos not Igbos, this a high level of ethinic hatred against igbos that Femi fanni Kayode who one time disguise self and a true friend of the Igbos and a good in-law was claiming to be speaking out against the margalization of the Igbos in Nigeria now displaying his true colour of hate against the Ndigbo. This again has validated Indigenous people of Biafra call for independent state of Biafra and their recent call for Biafra exodus from Lagos and other part of Nigeria outside Biafra land . Ndigbo must make haste while the sun shines . Nigeria is not one country let alone one nation and the hatrd against Ndigbo is not going to stop any time soon as much as politic of hate and religious division has been the bases to enforce fraudlent one Nigeria establishment . The bigotry statement of Some Yorubas during this era of the Nigeria jamboree selections called election should be à wake up call to Ndigbo who still think that they are component part of this British creation. Do not forget so soon that during the recent campaign these same set of people campaigning against igbos taking over Lagos are thesame people who campaigned against voting an Easterner with claim that under Peter Obi administration those infrastructure that the federal government denied Ndigbo such as railroad, Seaport and international airport shall be built. Añd If that happens their shall be mass exodus of Ndigbo from Lagos to Igbo land as Ndigbo Igbo will prefer retuning their investment home thereby coursing Lagos to be deserted and all the taxes that Lagos government are gaining will reduce coursing the fall of Lagos .Now today thesame set of people has manuover themselves to victory yet they are not satisfied they keep inciting violence against the Igbo business and properties in lagos .

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE RESTORATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA, AS PROCLAIMED BY MAZI NNAMDI KANU (Nwachineke) SUPREME LEADER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF BIAFRA WORLD WIDE AND DIRECTOR RADIO AND BAIFAR TELEVISION. Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA (J.P) Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra) 1. An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide, this evening we are going to remember those that died including those that died in 1967, and genocide killings around the world. 2. Today is a very sad day in this struggle. In this movement, today being the 13th day of September 2020. 3. This is Radio Biafra and we are being listened to all over the world. You can listen to us in all platforms, I know Facebook is supressing our listeners base and I say it in their face, and i dare them. 4. In IPOB we are sound minded, we know where we are going, we know what we are doing. 5. Something struck me, I came across a prayer of a genocide. 6. Have you ever asked yourself why was Biafra removed in the list of holocaust nations? Because you have a weak leadership whom are only after power. 7. The reason why you feel like your life is over when you are removed from IPOB is because we are potent. 8. The complicity and duplicity of Ohaneze ndi-igbo. 9. Igbo governors and Ohaneze were busy plotting with those that killed their parents to come and kill IPOB, that is how foolish Efulefu is. 10. All the time we always win, we always prevail, that is why the ZOO is finished and defeated. 12. The ZOO army can do all they like but they cannot stop this movement. 13. In South Africa, the apartheid regime were shooting sporadically, but did that stop the agitation? 14. The same people that killed your parent, you called to kill your children, how foolish can you be? That is why Efulefu is useless and stupid. 15. Is just like Nathan Nyahu having problem with some israelite and he runs to Nazi Germany and ask them to come and killed people. 16. How can somebody address those that instigated operation python dance as intellectual, can someone please explain that to me? 17. Britain is our problem because they hate Biafra with passion. 18. Why do I speak the way i speak, because they don't want us to live, they want all of us dead. Even the British high commissioner in Abuja she want all of us to die off. 19. Ask yourself what did we do to Mark Zucker bagger? But he came to Nigeria to collect money to work against Biafra TV. 20. They know with you Africa will be liberated, they know with you, you will be the next Japan of Africa. So they are doing whatever the can to stop you. 21. Abacha is a representation of evil and darkness if a Nigger-arean. 22. When was the last time the President and INEC chairman came from the same place? Go and read it, i know that anything more than two lines, Sabo cannot read. 23. Is only your fear that will allow Fulani to take your land, if you are a COWARD. 24. I am going to give Obasanjo advise live on air, of course Obasanjo is an agent of neo colonialism those who wants the ZOO to remain as one. 25. How can you be proud of what neither you, your grand father nor yourself created? Something that was created by a drunken white trash. 26. The reason why when Obasanjo and Jonathan was there things where good, do you know why, because they went to the same school a white man went to, but now JANJAWEED is there things are upside down, they are practicing JANJAWEEDISM. 27. Something a white man created to benefit him, Britain did not create the ZOO to benefit you and you are here working so hard to protect the such. 28. I don't know if people in the ZOO are human beings . They said that they will probe Obasanjo but they cannot probe Haliburton. 29. I had a sip of water, something the mask wearer cannot do. 30. Who do you think that excluded Biafra from the list of people that suffered holocaust? Of course is Britain. 31. Calling for a probe into haliburton, only IPOB can call for such, more other person can call for such probe. 32. Edwin Clark must apologize for his role in sabotaging Biafra during the Biafran war. 33. After fifty something years Middle belt has come out to apologize for their role in Baifran war, and I can assure you that Fulani cannot do you anything. 34. The next thing they are going to do now is to go from back and begin to beg you to unite again as one northern people. 35.

The Fulani janjaweeds are flooding into various parts of our land with arms and ammunition. * The largest ethnic group we have in Biafraland is Igbo and I will prove it tonight because evidence abounds. * Ask yourself why is it only in the North that traditional names are retained but here in the South, they named you Delta, Cross River, Rivers and you accepted. The Europeans have it as a weapon of destruction by destroying your name. The same thing once happened to Israel when they renamed it Palestine which is a corrupt version of Philistine. The same way the Jews are hated, is the same way they hate Biafrans. Recall that I have severally been to places in the United States of America, to tell the Igbos that the Fulanis were coming to kill our people but they all neglected my warnings. It is unfortunate that it is now happening before our very eyes. * When they proscribed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), you were busy clapping and celebrating. You are so useless and shameless. You were busy insulting IPOB, that they are on social media but today, you are busy doing videos, begging. You are now making videos abroad, crying over the influx of the Fulanis into your land which shows that you are an idiot. * I am warning you tonight, if you are found doing video on Internet from abroad, IPOB will attack you and I will call your name on air to decimate you publicly. * Have you ever seen a big church auditorium in Biafraland? The answer is No! Evangelist Rev. Dr. Uma Ukpai, the great preacher of the gospel from Biafraland based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, could not be supported by Biafran Christians to build giant church auditorium in Biafraland. All the big churches are established in Yorubaland. They are ashamed of building big church auditoriums in Biafraland and Biafrans are in those churches paying their tithes and offerings to their Yoruba General Overseers, who were muslims. * Anywhere you see any Fulani in your land, point him to the houses/compounds belonging to those Igbos living in USA, who have refused to part with their money in support of the security of their villages. It is a direct order! * Do you know that those Fulani young men trooping into our land are all foot soldiers? They are well sponsored by the Northern Islamic elites. * I am very mad at our Biafran brothers living in USA because they do not care about the life of those living back home in Biafraland. I met them severally in 2015, telling them that the Fulanis were coming to our land. Do you know that only Biafrans in America can comfortably fund a war for five good years without complaints? * The Fulanis have a target over our land. They have succeeded in installing Hope Uzodimma as the Governor of Imo State in order to accomplish their evil Islamic agenda. They are now planning to install an Islamic loyalist in Ohaneze Ndigbo presidency. * Our so-called elders are very useless and hopeless to the extent that they cannot even stand on any decision against the Arewa and Fulani Caliphate. * When I was about coming out from detention, I got an information that the Nigerian government was prepared to dialogue and negotiate with IPOB but Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East Governors said No. How can they be around and the government be negotiating with IPOB? They vowed to rather proscribe IPOB which they hurriedly did. Are you aware that the South-East Governors were the first to proscribe IPOB before the zoo (Nigeria) government did? Today, who are the people that will stop the janjaweed terrorists from the invasion of our land? * Today being Wednesday 20th of May 2020, write it down that I said, ""Fulani will take over Yorubaland within two years time"". I laugh at them with their so-called ""Amotekun"" Security Outfit which has been compromised. Yorubas are cowards and they are very useless. Like what is happening in Edo State, which has now been taken over by the Fulani janjaweeds. Yet the monarch is very complicit of the situation. * I traveled somewhere in Savanna, Georgia, USA, and I was told of what happened to a group of Biafrans who rather preferred to die than being slave servants to whitemen, their fellow humans. They joined themselves in chains, fell together into a deep river closeby and drowned. The history is still available up till this moment. I have been there. * In the year 1929, Richard Nickson stated that the Igbos are the wandering Jews of Africa because of the killings of the Igbo people all over the world just like how the Jews of Israel were killed. * Therefore, every ethnic group in Biafraland that has been going through this same condition are all Igbos and there is no doubt about it. * Everybody in Biafraland originated from Anambra, the house of Gadin Agulu-eri.

But 6 months down the line we are still broadcasting and waxing stronger. Isn't God wonderful?. To mark our 6 months of coming on board, we will be having a special marathon broadcast. I will be on air for 12 solid hours from 10am - 10pm Biafran times. ""My names are Mazi Clifford Chukwuemeka Iroanya. I came from Aro-Ndionyemaobi in Oguta LGA of Imo State, Biafra land.

The day's broadcast was hosted and anchored by Mazi Clifford Chukwuemeka Iroanya from the RBi broadcast studio in Houston - Texas, USA. The broadcast started at about 10:33am Biafran time. The news headlines of the day was thereafter read by our own adorable, NwaAda Chidinma Onu and includes:- (1) APC is confused - Rabiu Kwankwaso (2) Why outsiders control the oil blocks in Niger Delta ----Olu of War.

(4) MASSOB kicks against attack on Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB, celebrates 18 years anniversary. (5) Leadership totally disconnected with the People - Tony Nnadi The host while analysing the news headlines of the day started by making it known that he hates to talk about Buhari because according to him, the so called President of Nigeria is totally EMPTY in all ramifications. In his words... ""Buhari is empty. He is empty educationally, intellectually empty, he is empty about Policies. In fact, he did not even improve himself after he was overthrown in 1985"" He went further to explain that even the unbinding communique of the South East Governors did not say that IPOB is proscribed, saying that, it is the activities of IPOB that they claim to proscribe and thus urges our people to correct those making same the mistake of saying that IPOB has been proscribed on all platforms. The eloquent speaking Mazi Chike Okologbo while analysing the news headlines of the day started by saying that Ohanaeze has been footdragging on issues that has to do with the welfare of our people. He advised all Biafrans in Biafra land to go on strike until the Boko Haram Army Personnel currently intimidating innocent people in the name of conducting Operation Python dance II Biafra land returned to Sambisa forest where they ought to be fighting Boko Haram. He also condemned the unbinding so-called proscription of IPOB activities by the South East Governors wondering where the audacity to take such a charade decision came from. The host took calls from listeners during the broadcast. The callers included:- Mazi UzoChukwu Onyekachukwu called from New York City, USA as the first caller of the day. He is calling to advise Biafrans to disregard the statement from Rabid Kwankwaso that APC is confused (as read in item 1) of the news headlines of the day alleging that Rabid Kwankwaso was amongst those fingered in the northern agenda of destroying Biafran owned business via harmful policies and other means.

For one, it was a gangster act. For another, it was a sleek score for Nigerian Intelligence. For the Igboho saga, no one saw the attack as act of heroism. It was a forest cat nibbling a rat. But the matter for this essayist started before the two onslaughts. The intelligence forces invited the acerbic cleric Gumi over. It was not to probe or poke him. His hoary beard and whirlwind tongue remained intact. It was the show before the show-off. They gave Gumi a slap on the wrist. Kanu had cuffs on the wrist. For a different grist, Igboho had blood on his street. I wonder how a southern priest chummy with bandits would have swayed under this state? Would he have the fortitude to walk the forest aisles? Would he not be tagged a rebel leader or collaborator? Will they say he gave a baptismal fire to bandits? Or will they call him an anointer of the men of blood? Won’t they coerce him to bare the geographical details of their hideouts. Won’t they go to their bush havens, bomb and flush them out, and put paid to the narrative of mayhem and slaughter? Why the lopsided magistracy? Why is it rage here, and softness there, when all over we need the equality of official justice? Yet, I have no tears to shed for Kanu, or a case to make for an ethnic entrepreneur who slayed peace in his homeland he sought to save, called Yoruba clerics to be stoned to death, carried the passport of a zoo country and, by implication, making himself a zoo ambassador or a monkey or hyena in the babel of caged squealers. He consecrated cutting the ears or lopping off heads, paralysed a region for his ego for a few days. The people feared his security forces more than the official ones. He virtually committed a coup in the east, atrophied official Nigeria in the region, and installed a de facto Biafra. In spite of Operation Python Dance, the Igbo dreaded the ESN more. The snake crawled as though coy when Kanu squalled. The centre watched like a spectator. It recalls the rebellion under the geriatric King David in the Bible when one of his sons ogled the throne. “And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest not.” For me, it makes little sense to speculate whether it was right to pick him up or not. How naïve Kanu was to allow kudi to lure him out of his lair. It shows how half-cooked a rebel or hero he is, and how he pined for the lush life of the flesh, as Lai Mohammed said. Lai Mohammed may be right, but he was wrong-headed. Is it not in the same government that we have seen men, like the attorney general, mint parties? He made financial excess into moral excrescence in the extravagance of Naira rain? We must not forget that it was Buhari, who made Kanu into a monster. Just as Mazisi Kunene in his epic poem turned Shaka the Zulu into a monster by killing his love Noliwe, Buhari made Kanu into a gradual descent into a hate machine. In the Jonathan years, he was an outlier, an irritant and, at best, an entertainer. The Jonathan administration made the Igbo the centre. His middle name was Azikiwe. He gave appointments and contracts to their elites. When oil was over $100 dollars per barrel, he did not see the bad roads in the region, or do any consequential project for the folks. But they were happy with him. Sentiment upended welfare. Enter Buhari. The opposite is the story. Buhari has done more work in infrastructure for the east with his trojan of works, Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) than any leader since Gowon. But Buhari stirred the eastern fury. He alienated them in appointments, and tars them as pariah in his rhetoric. He has up till today not learned how to speak with them. He speaks at them. Even if he paves the eastern infrastructure in gold, they will not hug him. It is a lesson in leadership sanctified in the words of Oscar Wilde: sentiment is more important than reason. We may recall that Soyinka hails Amaechi for the western train and would not acknowledge Buhari. History will however restore that credit. Not now. History is repeating itself in the north. Buhari is doing to the north what Jonathan did to the east. He is plying the elite with appointments while neglecting the streets. Especially in security. His northern elite may like him, but their people are suffering. They are dying on the streets, their blood mixing with their farm millets and corns. Their daughters are losing their virginal flow to goons. Their wives are widowed in their teens. The talakawa politician has suddenly lost the ability to look down over his high shoulders. There was an obsession with Kanu, and it might have accounted for why he put off his trip for medical check-up. That can wake up his biological clock. Finding Kanu might have refuelled his haemoglobin and reengineered his heartbeat. What a health boost. The obsession was funny when a northern group gave a 100 million Naira bounty on Kanu’s (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/SOmatseye/photos/a.1551739391530419/3983466841690983/?type=3,,,,,,,,3,-0.67

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA 1. An opening prayer in the language of heaven by the prophet of Elohim, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. We have to proceed very speedly and very unorthodox to preach this gospel. 3. Our enemies are not sleeping at all, their Saboteurs, and all the traitors are not sleeping , therefore we shall not sleep either. 4. You must listen very very carefully, very very carefully . Listen to the voice of the founder of Bokoharam, Ali ndume. Is on video. 5. BBC had been against us during the war , it didnt start today. So what Facebook is doing is not new. 6. Every blessed day when we wake up, all we have to do is to remind them that we are unshakeable . 7. Politicians in nigeria , their job is to deceive people. It is their job to make sure you have no electricity, no good roads , no schools. 8. Nigerians also deceive themselves. They dont call for accountability, and that is why we call them a ZOO. 9. You cannot afford to be discouraged, our determination is unquestionable. 10. If you are wondering how evil a black man is , you must listen to what this man is saying , Ali ndume. 11. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down. That is why it is too easy for JANJAWEED to hold us down and kill us, to invade and to divide us at will. 12. Britain started this, as soon as they realised that we are children of God. 13. Another problem we have is igbo man love for gossip and back bite, it has to do with jealousy and enviness. 14. The reason why you will never hear about this Fulani invasion in any media is because they are all in their payroll. 12. This evening we are continuing our effort to unite Biafrans around the world, especially those in Biafraland. 13. When other people are grouping together you are busy gossiping, trying to divide each other . 14. This debate about Niger Delta is still raging. Saboteurs are hiding under the name niger delta to fight Biafra, to justify the deal they have entered into. 15. Biafrans are the most second hated people in the world. They see the blessing of God in you they hate you. 16. You cannot fight for Biafra unless you Unite the children of Elohim. 17. They think they can intimidate us, they think this is during the war when they media blockaded us while they were slaughtering us. Those days has gone. 18. Isn't it ironic , that children are now teaching the ""elders"" what they elders were supposed to be teaching us. 19. All we are doing is to shine the light and the people must choose where to follow. 20. Only an igbo man will deny that he never collected money when he has. 21. I want the whole world to know how an igbo man is behaving, self deceit and deception . This is why JANJAWEED are slaughtering us in our land. 22. So fools will ask , cant we make it igbo nations. Then I ask you, are you more igbo than an igbo in cross river ? Are you more igbo than igbo in igboakiri?. 23. That is why your politicians are useless, they cant defend you. 24. Why is it that Nnamdi Azikiwe and all your igbo leaders never borderd to unite you ? If not IPOB JANJAWEED will use you to make pepersoup. 25. Since 1940, Mazi Mbonu Ejike kept telling Azikiwe to drop one Nigeria and he refused and you want me to regard him as a great man. 26. What is it about Biafra that makes Britian to get ugly whenever you mention Biafra. 27. We are still going stronger than ever, and there Is no stopping us. 28. Nkpor massacre, do you know whom to be blame ? The Pig in the Creek, Asari Dokubo. 29. Everyday you gossip, all we need now is weapon to defend Biafraland. 30. Defense fund, Defense fund, and I say show me an igbo man that can bring out 100,000 USD to defend his land? 31. How many millionaires do you have in Biafraland, and yet none of them can bring out a cent to defend their land. 32. Nnamdi Azikiwe failed, and so called igbo leader has also failed, and they will continue to fail. 33. I told you that BBC is a fraud and I will proof it to you tonight . 34. I want Biafrans to know who their enemies are . 35. Gowon a Christian was chosen by the north to slaughter the Christians in Biafraland for them. 36. The only reason why the hated an igbo man is because of his success, everywhere they go , they survive . 37. I have nothing against Yoruba, I only hate traitors, the same wany i hate a traitor in igboland 38. The British organized Aburi conference, not because they want peace , but to have a reason to slaughter and orchestrate Genocide against our people. 39. On getting back to Lagos, on the instruction of the british including the Oba of Benin, because of their hatred for an igbo man the decline on Aburi. 40.

I CRY FOR MY PEOPLE!

As Nnamdi Kalu and his Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) threa*ten to declare Third Wor*ld Wa*r in Aba come 31st of this month, it is now time for us Igbos to tell ourselves some home truth. 

First, I don't know about you, but I am alarmed! The sort of following this man and his movement is attracting, if not checked immediately will create a big problem in the East, the sort of problem the North East experienced in the hands of Boko Haram. 

This man calls for w*ar against the Federal Govt of Nigeria, but curiously enough, the ba*ttle ground is not Lagos, Abuja, not Kaduna, not Kano, but sadly Aba, Onitsha, Owerri, Enugu, Okigwe, and other major Igbo cities.  Please, who will be the casualties?

And if you think this is mere joke, let me inform you that recently two prophets were paraded in Orlu for being in possession of 10 AK*47 riffl*es. And they confessed that they were contracted by this same Nnamdi to source those weapons. They claimed to have been given initial N300, 000, out of N1m promised them. So, it is no more joke!

Earlier, before then, this same Nnamdi had through his Radio Biafra, made public appeal to Igbos all over the world to support their bid for armament. And I was shocked when I saw the massive support he was getting for this cause. Where will these wea* pons be deployed and on whom? Igbo land, and on the Igbos!

This same Nnamdi is in serious w*ar of words with members of MOSOB, and in fact all prominent Igbo politicians. And you wonder, the sort of battle that will ensue in Igbo land among the Igbos themselves; before anyone will even think about taking the fight to the federal government again.

The same Barr Nnamdi has commanded Igbos all over the world to gather in Aba on 31st May in remembrance of our fallen heroes. He assures all Igbo that anybody who would try to stop them will meet fire for fire. Curiously, 31st is less than a week; I've not heard Nnamdi say that he has procured his visa to come home and lead the onslaught. He is cocooned in the comfort of his UK home to the best of my knowledge. And others are mobilizing here for him, while he is leading the war from UK.

 I fear for my people; He is speaking what we want to hear, how Nigeria is a zoo, and how the whole world hate us, how we must be given our own Biafra ""by fire by force"". And with this, our reasoning sense has taken flight, and anyone who is a bit sceptical or cautious of this movement has become the enemy of the Igbo nation. He has become a saboteur.

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA 1. An opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. For gathering against his children, the ZOO called Nigeria shall be destroyed 3. Nwike I want to ask you a question , was Obigbo on lockdown yesterday or not ? And where is Obigbo, is it not in Rivers State 4. Ask any banker you know in Igweocha, did you open for business ? 5. Because an order was given and they listened, the idiot came on Channels TV, he could not even sit well, Mrs. Tambowal 6. Parts of Rivers state was on lockdown , is it true or not ? 7. Our eternal leader, Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu must be happy with Ikonso where they are 8. And some of the Governors , including Obiano who built a senotab ad well as Okowa we commend you 9. I want to also remember the interview Ikpazu had, it was commendable, including Dave Umahi he behaved like a man 10. I wont even mention the sariki of imo state , he is not even a Governor. He came out to challenge us and said that the lockdown will not hold but he was disgraced 11. That is why everything IPOB touches turns into gold. Today we are the most powerful mass movement in the world 12. Do you think that its us that is doing it, its God almighty , that it is why we give a command today and the whole world listens 13. The only people that did something decent is the vanguard newspaper 14. Tinubu thinks he can use the media to bamboozle all of us, that's what they do 15. There are some profession that does not suit black people , profession that requires honesty 16. Most of you does not know that Aguiyi Ironsi is from my claan, ibeku. The first battle field general 17. That is why history forgot about them because of their idiotcy 18. It was Okpara economic miracle that frightened Britian , and that's why they organized the first coup 19. The first man that his regional economy supersedes that if the whole world 20. When we ask you to sit at home you must comply , it is for your own good and that of your family 21. And I must commend Obiano for building the senotab, very commendable 22. I said it yesterday and I want to say it again , Obiano, Umahi, Okowa they where all commendable 23. Imo state was not under lockdown, imo state was under chain, (ekere ya eke) 24. Anything is possible this days , do you know that men can become pregnant, maybe Nwike had a miscarriage, a man who sits on a chair like a woman 25. It is only in Africa that Pastors owes private Jets, but Pope who is the richest owes no private jet 26. Apart from Dele Giwa and few other journalist and Dele Momudu, the rest are the journalist ? 27. During a referendum you will only have one vote, even me Nnamdi Kanu I will have one vote 28. Nwike I want you to understand that Rivers state was created on 27th of May 1967. 29. That was the day Eastern consultative conference gave Ojukwu the mandate to declare Biafra, 27thMay 1967 that is. 30. People dont know why they call that day ""children's day "" as the British intelligence got the Intel that Ojukwu has been given the mandate to declare Biafra , they asked Gowon to divide them and rule, that was how Rivers state was created 31. Allow Nwike to continue deceiving all of you 32. Ojukwu asked , what shall we call this our new nation, and an ijo man called Frank Opigo said Biafra, and Ojukwu asked why Biafra? He whispered and said not here I will tell you later. 33. Ojukwu did not complain, and God was upon Ojukwu and he conceded and said this new nation shall be called Biafra 34. Nwike you dont know your history, you dont even know the history of your village 35. THE SOLDIERS ARE MOLESTING PEOPLE IN ABA RIGHT NOW, WHEN THE SAINTS REACT NOW AND SEND THEM TO GOD FOR JUDGEMENT YOU WILL COMPLAIN 36. Before the independent of the ZOO there where no identity crisis . 37. I ve always tried to proof to them that igbo race where Made up of three race . The house of Ephraim , 38. The reason why we keep having this debate is because our people are not educated, if you can take out few minutes to read the willins report , you will understand that our people are not educated 39. Head Bridge was closed down few days ago, the avenger came out and said they are going to blow up the oil pipe lines if they dont open it up 40. A white man said in 1968 , this people that inherbits the Plato of rivers, that we call Igweocha, you people are igbos, smart and energetic 41. These people they hate us because we are wise and hard working, that is why they brought Amed Gulaik to Owerri and killed him so that they can demonize us and Kill us all 42. They have been frustrating us so that we can ask them to give us five states and abandoned our brothers , but we said no we are going with our brothers 43. They called you Delta, but they called themselves Ariwa, nobody is calling them the Sahelian (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/biafrajewishpost/photos/a.919505951741153/1441515066206903/?type=3,,,,,,,,3,-0.75

My people in Akwa-Ibom they say ""Abasi mbong"" our people in urhobo say Tamuno. 4. I want you to pay attention to what I have to say this evening. 5. You have heard this clip before very many years ago and I want you to hear what this JANJAWEED has to say. 6. I want to prove all beyond every reasonable doubt that Fulani is the problem. 7. As I play this audio, somebody should put it on my page, that the world will know that Fulani never meant Nigeria to work from day one. 8. Buhari was following the footsteps of sardauna of Sokoto. 9. What this man said since 1950 is still active in our life today. 10. I am going to play the voice of this man again so that you can understand that this whole thing was planned years ago. 11. I want Wike, I want Ozodimgba to listen to me very well. 12. What APC is carrying out today was laid down before 1960. 13. Britain knew that Fulani hated igbo people because Britain hated igbo people. Why Britain hated igbo people is beyond me. 14. The North hates the east, they love the yoruba a little bit. that's why they said they are not leaving. 15. What is this hate or hatred for the Igbo? what has the igbos done? 16. Tribal tension has been there before the 60's and am asking people when will this tension stop? 17. A white man is asking a black baboon from Africa why do you hate a black man like you. 18. I want to prove to efulefus in the Zoo how the hatred in the Zoo today was brought. 19. Igbo people are ancient people ""ndi gboo"" that is why the are occupying the centre of the world. 20. Biafra is beyond what man can understand. 21. How did they dominate you, because everywhere they go to even a white man will ask them to run their work. 22. When you hear other tribe joining them to castigated Biafra don't blame them, anybody who is castigating Biafra will not make heaven. 23. This happened in the late 40's and Buhari has replicated the same northernisation and fulanisation. 24. Now let me prove it to you that what this man is saying over 60 years ago is still active today. 25. I have given you the first Fulani Gordy agenda of Fulanisation headed by Amadu Bello a reprobate. 26. The daughter of Abba Kyari is the one controlling the whole money of the Zoo and all of you are there shouting one Nigeria like mad people. 27. How God sent the unknown gun men we don't know but we are praying for them. 28. Let me remind some of you fools like Hope Uzodima. He said we hijacked ESN. 29. Hope Uzodima don't you wear Pampers and your fellow men are busy destroying you. 30. When they invite you to Sokoto that night you start sweating because you know what they will do you in the night. 31. NO MORE FUND RAISING IN THE ZOO, YOU ARE SOLDIERS YOU STAY IN THE BUSH UNTIL YOU ARE REFILLED . 32. On this note we have come to the end of this programme.

A lot of things have happened in the last couple of weeks in Nigeria that got people talking.

I am not an authority, whose voice can be taken as yea and amen, but I have a few people who believe in my school of thought. Some WhatsApped, called and texted to know what I feel.

I will handle them one by one and be as brief as possible.

THE DEATH OF TB JOSHUA AND THE BROUHAHA SURROUNDING HIS BURIAL.

To me, he lived a practical life of a Christian and passed away peacefully. May he rest in peace.

If Pastors or Bishops attend his burial or not, it won't raise him back to life, neither will it guarantee his passage into heaven.

I think it would have been shocking for the GOs that were accused of not attending his burial to actually attend. It was best the maintained their status quo and stayed away.

Same you (online judges) would have come for their heads if they attended. Fair enough, one of the leading fathers of Faith, sent a letter to his wife consoling her and the Church. He even mentioned that they will meet on the last day, meaning TB Joshua may have made it to heaven.

ARREST OF NNAMDI KANU, SELF ACCLAIMED LEADER OF IPOB.

All freedom fighters are smart and look arrogant, but they should also be wise.

Nnamdi Kanu is not a wise man...

You fight Buhari, fight Nigeria, fight the Igbo people, insult everything you see including your wife, and you expect to be kept in hiding forever?

It will amaze you to know that, he also badmouths the British Government and people.

""If you have to shoot, shoot don't talk."" I believe those who watched the movie 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" will remember these lines.

Any river that forgets its source will run dry. Nnamdi Kanu is a butterfly who thinks himself a bird, and sadly, he wants the world to respect him, yet he disregards everyone in sight.

If you call Nigeria a Zoo, it means people in it are animals, so what kind of treatment do you expect from animals? Enjoy your animal kingdom!

NIGERIAN IDOL: BENUE SON ATELA FRANCIS LOSING OUT!

Benue has two major tribes and by extension, three. The Tiv and the Idoma people are the Major, but the Tiv are the Major-Major due to number.

I will not be afraid to say the voting for the Benue son, a Tiv guy was tribalized and ethnicized. All the voting centers were Tiv-Centric and headed by the Tiv people.

There was no voting actively in any part of the Idoma or Igede kingdom, even if there were, I didn't see.

The guy (Kingdom) who won was roundly supported by the people of Bayelsa, not minding their tribal difference. I will post the list of voters he appreciated after the show in the comment section.

To my Tiv friends, activists and social media influencers, until we stop seeing Tiv actors as Tiv sons, Idoma actors as Idoma sons and Igede actors as Igede sons, we shall keep experiencing this ""almost victory syndrome"".

Even after giving us a good performance, he has not been given a rousing home reception like the Big Brother Naija guy, Kiddwaya who lost and didn't do us proud like Atela. When I asked why, I was told that my inquisitiveness is too early, I should wait.

I still dey wait o!

THE DUNAMIS PROTEST STAGED BY OMOYELE SOWORE

In summary, Omoyele Sowore is a mad man. He should go to the National Mosque in Abuja or the Kano Central Mosque and stage his 'Buhari Must Go' protest. Is Buhari a member of Dunamis?

Mumu man!

THE SACK OF PASTORS AT LIVING FAITH CHURCH WORLDWIDE.

A man that is called by God cannot be sacked by man. If you get served a letter of release, prove your calling by looking up to the caller, not Social media commentators....

THE ARREST OF SUNDAY IGBOHO, SELF ACCLAIMED LEADER OF THE YORUBA NATION.

Sunday Igboho had my sympathy until the day he mocked God's servant, Pastor E. A Adeboye over the death of his son.

I knew his end was in sight, he should seek forgiveness and make peace for all to be well with him again. 

No matter who/what a Pastor is, don't mock him especially over an issue we all must face, death.

Everybody reading this post will not be alive on earth after 100 years, meaning we all must die. So why the hate?

RIP to Sound Sultan. Ur death is painful! 

The end...

This man is the only threat to the Nigeria government because he keeps exposing their lies. He is the only visible instrument of checks and balances to this government. All other arms have compromised to brown envelope; even Channels TV I once revered. Believe me when I tell you this; in their covens and secret meetings, Nnamdi Kanu is always at the front burner of their agenda because they feel he knows too much; even their deepest secrets Mazi gets hold of it. This scares them. Nnamdi Kanu exposed Channels TV for deceiving Nigerians that the last and previous presidential speeches by the impostor was a live recorded media speech. Channels TV correspondent called it a LIVE chat that day, not only that, they visibly wrote ""LIVE"" on their screen. Guess what? Nnamdi Kanu carefully pulled his facts and pieces of research and watet-tight information together and blasted out to counter the lies and deceit. At first rebuttal, the media man of the presidency in the person of Adesina, affirmed their claim that the last media speech was a live transmission. But now he bowed to the undeniable and irrefutable facts and evidences Nnamdi Kanu reeled out to the world to see. It indeed made sense! Adesina has bowed to truth and agreed that it was indeed a pre-recorded speech and that his boss Buhari has the prerogative of talking to Nigerians in any manner he so deems fit. Recently in a live media interview, Adesina suggested that Nigerians are 'used tissue paper'; so when next you frown that Nnamdi Kanu called Nigeria a zoo, to me he was being too polite. You have heard it, you are seen as a used tissue paper by the president's media adviser. Zoological animal is even a better fit Nigeria is one of the most useless entities I have seen so far. Go and watch that video where Adesina was interviewed and listen to the gutter rubbish oozing out of his mouth. Also watch the video of where the patients of Covid-19 virus in kano are being asked for some bribe to get medication and food allegedly by the so-called NCDC officials. Most of them got nothing! They are protesting and many broke loose from the isolation camp and escaped. Nobody is speaking of this ill except Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yet you feel he is just for the Biafrans. I LOVE NNAMDI KANU! Long live Nnamdi Kanu!!

1.  An opening prayer by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra,  and in the same vein, the director of both Radio and Biafra television.

2.  I will continue to stream and there is nothing Facebook can do about it. If the Yoruba people working for Facebook like, let them cut me off and I will take them to court in the United States not in the ZOO.

3.  I have two jobs assigned to me by Elohim.  One is to restore Biafra, and the last one is to ensure that the name Nigeria does no longer exist. When am talking write it down.

4.  This is why I always ask you to come with your pen and paper

5.  O'kwanu eligwe zie mu ozi m'zie ndi di ndu, (heaven gives me message and I give to the living)

6.  The more they talk about us the more they promote us. Everywhere you go the words in the lips of everyone is IPOB and Nnamdi Kanu, and I love it.

7.  All of you are not offended to go to Europe that killed you in millions, but you are offended of being insulted by Nnamdi Kanu.

8.   Why do we expose the Ohaneze ndi oshi na ndi ara na ndi ama. I am going to tell you the reason why we are harsh on them and speak the way we do.

9. After listening this night you will stone them.

10.  Can you imagine the number of  illegitimate children we have in Biafraland after fighting a war, these are the people and the idiots you see on social media.

11.  Gowon said , if I knew that Igbo loved money so much i  wouldn't have gone to war, i would have shared money to them to fight each other. And that is what they are doing now.

12.  After going to the ZOO and went to jail , when I came out I told them that they are going to rape and kill your wives and children.

13.  If they say to you when we are growing up, that somebody will come to your village and pick your daughter and nobody will say anything,  would you have believed it?

14.  You are there claiming that you are elder, and somebody travelled from Mali and came to your village and knock on the door , and pick up your daughter,  and you come up on Facebook and talk nonsense.  You people have no shame.

15.  I have been talking to you people since 2013 till 2017 and you people did not listen.

16.  Have you not seen the mess Yorubaland Is in, do you people think that you will bring Biafra to that level? Don't you people know whom we are?

17.  In Uli Anambra a girl was cut into pieces, and people are making mouth , I have money, where is the Governor? Where is Willie Obiano?

18.  I don't know what voice to use so that you people will understand the mess you are in, because you people have no shame.

19.  And you are walking about your business as if nothing happened because is not your daughter that is butchered. Do you see why I speak to you the way I do, because you have no empathy.
you are heartless and not human.

20.  And some satanic individuals will go about writring rubbish that it is farmers and herders clash.

21.  Darkness has taken over in our land, that men will see evil and condone it, and you expected to be nice to you.

22.  They went around Biafraland promising all the Governors Vice President position,  one single position to everybody, and what is the catch, by giving our land to Fulani.

23.  Are you listening what Obiano said. If you go to Anambra State now and kill a man all you have to pay is 500,000 naira. 

24.  As part of the deal for the rigging of his election,  Obiano went and brought in Myetti Allah as part of his government. 

25.  Every police station are under instruction to offer strategic support to killer Fulani as the Match down South.

26.  Nnamdi Kanu is insultive, while your daughters are being taken right before your eyes , which one is more insultive?

27.  Your daughters are being abducted, raped and cut into pieces and you are not ashamed. 

28.  Look at the woman who was abducted,  did the village vigilante do anything,  the answer is NO!!

29.  The people invading you are well organized,  they have over 30 billion stashed away, and you have nothing .

30.  And you are telling people, our people , go to your village and organize your vigilante, and am asking you, how can your village wage war against a Platinum of Fulani?

A few days ago, the Nigerian military leadership warned soldiers not to go on operations with phones and recording devices. A warning that came in the wake of the indiscriminate shootings and burning down of houses by the Nigerian soldiers in a small community located somewhere in Enugu State, which surfaced on the social media on the Monday 1st of November, 2021.

By every indication, the video was recorded by one of the soldiers, either as a revolt against what was being done by fellow soldiers or simply, out of sheer impudence to commit such heinous crimes and still go scot-free. But whatever be the case, the crucial factor here is that the beastly crime those soldiers committed on that day, is out there for all to see. And it is only one of many such atrocities.

The point has to be made about this incident so that we do not easily forget the horror that played out that day and also to give ourselves more time to digest the facts about the vampiric mortals adorning the uniforms of the Nigerian military. As it is not out of place to think that in this 21st century, the Nigerian military ought to have evolved into a modern, refined and humane institution primed to join the league of exemplary militaries across the world in the true service of humanity. But we could not have been more wrong and presumptuous of a military stubbornly stuck up in ancient times, that continues to show itself only as a barbaric force set out to maim and kill the very people it is supposed to protect. This institution has deteriorated into a worse condition than it was, prior to the government of Muhammadu Buhari.

The image of that day says it all. It speaks to the peculiar character of a military drunk with hate, coupled with an uninhibited power and authority to showcase its object of hate as it so chooses. In many ways, the characters looked far more deadlier than the weapons in their hands. 

A murderous set of soldiers, lethal and unforgiving by any description, firing away indiscriminately at any living thing and with relative ease and enjoyment. And in plain sight, was what seemed an infinite rage of anti-Igbo coloration, as if they were on a mission to fulfill an age-old prophetic mandate of apocalyptic retaliation. Be that as it may, this could not have been glossed over or swept under the rug anywhere else but in Nigeria. And going by the entrenched culture of impunity among the Nigerian politicians and members of the armed forces, none of these murderous soldiers or their commanders is likely to be held accountable or at least, queried by the Nigerian authorities. Which tells a very macabre yet, the true story of Nigeria; a country steeped in political and economic cannibalism.

And so, with such an ugly picture of indiscriminate shootings into people’s homes which is often replicated by the Nigerian military, it makes a lot of sense when ""zoo"" is metaphorically used to describe Nigeria. But not to put too fine a point on it, the metaphor is a bit too polished to fit a human abattoir like Nigeria, given that in a zoo, for example, animals have value and rights. Any attempt at jungle justice, attracts serious punishments.  

But in the Nigerian context, there is hardly any sense of human value among Nigerian leaders and the armed forces. It is a well known historic fact that Nigerian armed forces are undisciplined, brutal, brutally corrupt, polarized, barbaric and boundless in the commission of genocides and various other atrocious crimes against humanity. Similarly, the government of Nigeria is in lockstep with them, sanctioning all the killings of unarmed civilians and then turn around to frame such events in a way that absolves them of any wrongdoings. At present, both the military and the government are indoors plotting more military operations that will soon sweep through a broad swath of Igboland.

But then again, the necessary question to ask the Nigerian government and the military generals is, what more operations are you expecting your soldiers to carry out? Let me guess: they are to embark on operations in small towns, villages, marketplaces or inside family homes in Igboland where harmless children and old people are likely to be found playing or going about their businesses. Or better still, carry out operations in the churches and synagogues where Igbo worshipers are mindlessly making spiritual and metaphysical connections, absolutely bothering no one. Maybe operations on the streets where your soldiers arbitrarily arrest or kill unarmed young Igbomen and women and tag them the UNKNOWN GUNMEN. 

Of note, these are the operations we have seen you carry out lately in Igboland, where your soldiers deliberately set peaceful communities on fire and turn around to act as the firefighters on a mission, then when the smoke clears up, the entire place is strewn with the blood of innocent Igbo people.

Sweat wisely - In Touch, The Nation newspaper, 05/07/2021 For the Nnamdi Kanu theatre, two eyes saw it in Nigeria. For one, it was a gangster act. For another, it was a sleek score for Nigerian Intelligence. For the Igboho saga, no one saw the attack as act of heroism. It was a forest cat nibbling a rat. But the matter for this essayist started before the two onslaughts. The intelligence forces invited the acerbic cleric Gumi over. It was not to probe or poke him. His hoary beard and whirlwind tongue remained intact. It was the show before the show-off. They gave Gumi a slap on the wrist. Kanu had cuffs on the wrist. For a different grist, Igboho had blood on his street. I wonder how a southern priest chummy with bandits would have swayed under this state? Would he have the fortitude to walk the forest aisles? Would he not be tagged a rebel leader or collaborator? Will they say he gave a baptismal fire to bandits? Or will they call him an anointer of the men of blood? Won’t they coerce him to bare the geographical details of their hideouts. Won’t they go to their bush havens, bomb and flush them out, and put paid to the narrative of mayhem and slaughter? Why the lopsided magistracy? Why is it rage here, and softness there, when all over we need the equality of official justice? Yet, I have no tears to shed for Kanu, or a case to make for an ethnic entrepreneur who slayed peace in his homeland he sought to save, called Yoruba clerics to be stoned to death, carried the passport of a zoo country and, by implication, making himself a zoo ambassador or a monkey or hyena in the babel of caged squealers. He consecrated cutting the ears or lopping off heads, paralysed a region for his ego for a few days. The people feared his security forces more than the official ones. He virtually committed a coup in the east, atrophied official Nigeria in the region, and installed a de facto Biafra. In spite of Operation Python Dance, the Igbo dreaded the ESN more. The snake crawled as though coy when Kanu squalled. The centre watched like a spectator. It recalls the rebellion under the geriatric King David in the Bible when one of his sons ogled the throne. “And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest not.” For me, it makes little sense to speculate whether it was right to pick him up or not. How naïve Kanu was to allow kudi to lure him out of his lair. It shows how half-cooked a rebel or hero he is, and how he pined for the lush life of the flesh, as Lai Mohammed said. Lai Mohammed may be right, but he was wrong-headed. Is it not in the same government that we have seen men, like the attorney general, mint parties? He made financial excess into moral excrescence in the extravagance of Naira rain? We must not forget that it was Buhari, who made Kanu into a monster. Just as Mazisi Kunene in his epic poem turned Shaka the Zulu into a monster by killing his love Noliwe, Buhari made Kanu into a gradual descent into a hate machine. In the Jonathan years, he was an outlier, an irritant and, at best, an entertainer. The Jonathan administration made the Igbo the centre. His middle name was Azikiwe. He gave appointments and contracts to their elites. When oil was over $100 dollars per barrel, he did not see the bad roads in the region, or do any consequential project for the folks. But they were happy with him. Sentiment upended welfare. Enter Buhari. The opposite is the story. Buhari has done more work in infrastructure for the east with his trojan of works, Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) than any leader since Gowon. But Buhari stirred the eastern fury. He alienated them in appointments, and tars them as pariah in his rhetoric. He has up till today not learned how to speak with them. He speaks at them. Even if he paves the eastern infrastructure in gold, they will not hug him. It is a lesson in leadership sanctified in the words of Oscar Wilde: sentiment is more important than reason. We may recall that Soyinka hails Amaechi for the western train and would not acknowledge Buhari. History will however restore that credit. Not now. History is repeating itself in the north. Buhari is doing to the north what Jonathan did to the east. He is plying the elite with appointments while neglecting the streets. Especially in security. His northern elite may like him, but their people are suffering. They are dying on the streets, their blood mixing with their farm millets and corns. Their daughters are losing their virginal flow to goons. Their wives are widowed in their teens. The talakawa politician has suddenly lost the ability to look down over his high shoulders. There was an obsession with Kanu, and it might have accounted for why he put off his trip for medical check-up. That can wake up his biological clock. Finding Kanu might have refuelled his haemoglobin and reengineered his heartbeat. What a health boost.

The Minister noted that the actions of Gumi cannot be compared to that of Kanu who is the leader of a proscribed group like IPOB. Mr. Mohammed said all these on Wednesday while speaking with state house correspondents in Abuja. The minister also noted that nobody appointed Gumi as spokesman for bandits, hence his actions are not in any way similar to Kanu’s. He noted further that there are many people “spewing hate” against President Muhamadu Buhari, adding if such people had been arrested, detention facilities would have been filled up. “Who appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this is what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu…anyway what we’re discussing is different,” the minister said. “We’re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead, but please, be objective. “There are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this government. So, if you want to comment, be fair; don’t take a position which is not objective. “If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up, and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law. “But I’m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly said, ‘go and kill policemen.’ I think sometimes…policemen are brothers; they are our uncles; they have children. “[When they’re killed], their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen? Because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that me and you can sleep? “It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.” Recall that just yesterday, SCOOPER reported how Kanu declared that his group is now very much ready to go all out and do whatever it takes to actualize Biafra nation. The secessionist leader also declared war on Nigerian security agencies, saying there must be a payback for any Biafran killed by Nigerian security agencies. Kanu said all these while sharing some images of South Easterners allegedly shot and killed by security operatives in the region. The IPOB leader seizing the opportunity said since the government has refused to conduct a referendum which, according to him, is the easiest way to go, his group are now ready to take Biafra by force. “What we ask is very simple. Give us referendum for the people to determine their fate in this Fulani controlled zoo called Nigeria,” Kanu said in a Facebook post. “But if referendum which is the easiest way to go about it can’t be assured, then we will take it by force. “We can never continue in a country created by a white man meant for their own interests which turns us into slaves. Never!. Our fathers accepted that but this generation said No. “Simply conduct referendum and allow the will of the people to reign. “The same way we triumph is same way we’ll continue to triumph to any option they present to us going forward.” Talking about the killing of some IPOB members in Imo and other parts of the Southeast, Kanu added, “I hope those half-baked graduates yapping on media are taking note of it!. “What these janjaweeds must understand is that it’s no longer the time we do cry to the world. “For any Biafran you kill, there must be a pay back. We will avenge their deaths with the heads of their killers Eye-for-an-eye.”",https://www.facebook.com/Zolexlivenews/photos/a.178410662686548/1063976350796637/?type=3,,,,,,,,2,-0.78

""And you are walking about your business as if nothing happened because it's not your daughter that is butchered. Do you see why I speak to you the way I do because you have no empathy, you are heartless and not human.

""And some satanic individuals will go about writing rubbish that it is farmers and herders clash. Darkness has taken over in our land, that men will see evil and condone it, and you expected me to be nice to you.

By Farooq Kperogi

I’ve known since the beginning of the month that Nnamdi Kanu would be arrested and extradited to Nigeria, but my informant swore me to secrecy, so I kept the information to myself. Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. 

While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem.

Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. 

When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.”

 He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then.

He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote.

But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari!

Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines.

This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t have known of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari.

Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",,,,2,-13

1.  Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 

2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened.

3.  Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 

4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 

5.  Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man,
 ignorance, stupidity,   jealousy, envy and  greed.

6.  It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 

7.  Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 

8.  I never wanted to preach this tonight,  but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 

9.  They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states.

10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 

11.  You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea.

12.  Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes.  The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 

13.  Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 

14.  Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 

15.  The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group,  you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 

16.  Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 

17.  But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB,  never.

18.  Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes .

19.  There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 

20.  Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 

21.  Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". 
you see, this is how they roll. 

22.  That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away,  that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 

23.  Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off,  and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 

24.  Have you ever wondered,  your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 

25.  Thanks to Radio Biafra,  people are now listening and have started to reason. 

26.  Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 

27.  As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 

28.  When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 

29.  The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you.

30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday,  and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course.

31.  As we always,  that Biafra is our Religion,  and here on Radio Biafra is where we worship,  Elohim Chukwu  Okike puru ime ihe n'ile is our God, I thank you all for listening , from me from here, is Goodevening",,,,1,0

1.  An opening prayer said by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 

2.  If you have joined us this evening you should be able to listen to us via my facebook page. The most persecuted page, and they have now taken the same to my Twitter account. 

3.  I can announce to you this evening that we have a new family in the Seychelles. 

4.  I am the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Director of Radio Biafra. 

5.  We must now proceed to preach this gospel that Elohim tasked us to preach. 

6.  The only place on this planet earth where there is coal, gas and oil. The only place is Biafraland. 

7.  This evening, if you have any Biafran army in the ZOO army you better start looking for them, because the news we are getting is not favorable. 

8.  They are now selecting Biafran soldiers and transferring them to the North, Borono to be precisely. 

9.  They are killing our people as am addressing you tonight, if you have any Biafran soldiers in the ZOO army, better start looking for them now  not tomorrow. 

10.  They were seen inside the barracks with our brothers sitting on the floor waiting to be transfered to Borono. 

11.  This evening we are placing the whole world on alart. If you have any relatives serving in the ZOO army, and you don't look for them now it will be too late by tomorrow. 

12.  I want the DSS to know tonight that there is nothing they are planning tonight that we are not privy to. 

13.  So before you put your heads to what you don't know, ask your friends in the army and police how far. 

14.  You people are terrorist in uniform,  you want to help the JANJAWEED to conquer our land.

15.  You want to come to Biafraland to abduct our coordinators, and i say come and abduct our people and see the stuff we are made of. 

16.  Before you will come and arrest and kill our people and we cry and you walk out free, now come and kill let God punish you all. 

17.  Any idiot that will come to Biafraland to kill, come and kill and you will die. 

18.  IT IS A DIRECT INSTRUCTION TO ALL VOLUNTEERS!!!!
ANY FULANI YOU SEE, BOTH WITH THE VEHICLES THEY COME WITH MUST BE BURNT DOWN!!!
ALLOW THEM TO COME IN AND THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE ROUTE !!!!!

19.  AND THE DAY WE CATCH SABO!!! WE WILL SET AN EXAMPLE WITH YOU THAT THE WORLD WILL KNOW HOW SERIOUS WE ARE. 

20.  We know who your informants are, if we don't spare your masters be rest assured that we will not spare you. 

21.  So REFERENDUM is good for Scotland but not for Biafrans, because we are blacks and you are whites. Blacks are inferior to whites that's the thinking. 

22.  SS and Scotland yard are not there arresting and killing the people in Scotland, but you want to kill Biafrans for asking for their freedom. 

23.  Scotland Prime Minister Nicholas Sturge has promised to publish the legislature to guarantee Scotland independence next year. 

24.  But in your own case they said no, no independence for you. 

25.  I asked for Osinbajo they went and published someone dancing like Papa Ajasco😂😂. 

26.  This thing Scotland is debating in the open, is the same reason DSS is coming to Enugu to kill Biafrans and the British high commissioner is in Abiuja collecting her own share of Petrol dollar. 

27.  Why is it that there is a woman sitting in Abuja but Scotland is busy agitating for independence in her own country and she is in Abuja supervising the killings of Biafra. 

28.  Hypocrisy, if the highest order and that is what we are here to oppose and we must oppose it. 

29.  Before the white men came there was no place called Nigeria,  only if you are an animal. 

30.  You know a black man has no shame, there is no dignity there is no honor.

31.  Anybody who opens their stupid idiotic mouth to say they are niggarian, you are lower than an animal to me, you are fool and a completely idiot. 

32.  It is good for Scotland, but not good for a Nigerian. 

33.  They said that a British minister was surprised, they never sent the military and the airforce to go and bomb Scotland. 

34.  You will hear somebody come on channels TV and say go and bomb them they are miscreant, then I ask, is Nicolas Sturgeon also a miscreant?

35.  Kosovo, Ukraine, Mecedonia all free, and all are in Europe,  
so only whites are allowed to be free, not blacks. 

36.  Britain, no fighter bomber to Scotland, they dialogued. But if is here in the ZOO, is pursue them and kill them, mad people. 

37.  Britain thought them how to kill Biafrans, as they killed our mothers and we never asked questions. 

38.  I want you to understand why Britain cannot talk, because they hate us they cannot stand us, and the same idiot gave us Anglican church.  
They gave us bible.

Nwawube Ezeobi | The Biafra Post June 1, 2020 Introduction:::::::} Mazi Nnamdi Kanu offers super prayer in the language of heaven as he asks for heavens intervention as our enemies have gathered our land. He also assured heaven that Biafra will never worship any graven image or anything born of a woman. 1. We are going to start in a way people did not expect us to. We want to lay the background on how the zoo became decayed. That humanity will understand the enormity of the problem facing those living in Nigeria. 2. Our enemies are not sleeping, the traitors are not sleeping therefore we must not sleep. Our enemies are numerous. 3. Ali Ndume is a Fulani janjaweed politician, listen to what he have to say about Nigeria, the video is everywhere, from their we will proceed. 4. Our enemies who are within are using the name of Biafra, their aim is to delay the coming of Biafra in order to please their masters. We have discovered their tactics and we are ready to defeat them. 5. Ali Ndume said they deceived people, that they are not honest. He is telling you that all of them are bad including Nigerians themselves. 6. It is their job to decieve you, it is their job to make sure you have no education. It is their job to make sure you have no jobs. Nigerians instead of fighting for their freedom, are busy fighting those fighting for them. 7. We must not get discouraged. Our determination is unquestionable. 8. If you are wondering how evil a black man can be, Ali Ndume is a good pointer. Ali Ndume is a man accused of sponsoring Boko Haram. 9. I want our people to understand that there are only two factors holding us down as a people, that is the reason why it has been easy for the Fulani janjaweed to invade our land, kill us and divide us at will. 10. They will do whatever they can to make you feel what you are doing is not working but believe you me, we are holding them at a very bad place. 11. Britain started this very concerted effort to make sure that Biafra did not see the light of the day when they found out we are the descendants of Israel that will bring light to Africa. 12. Another problem that we have is Igbo man's love for gossip and affinity to back-bite which have to do with greed, envy and jealousy that is why you have Fulanis' in our homes, bushes and markets. 13. Before the Fulani janjaweed decided to take over our land, they bribed every major media house in the world, BBC and Co. Now that they are invading, have you heard about it anywhere in the world analyzing this influx into Biafra territory?. 14. There is a global effort not to allow Biafra to emerge and the Igbo man is not helping either. These are the issues concerning us as a people and it is my duty to let the world know of it. 15. There are many things we do not appreciate or understand, that is why when we preach we use historical references that when you listen, you can never doubt it. 16. Igbo man are their own greatest enemy, when the enemy is busy planning how to take over your land, you are busy gossiping, carrying envy and being jealous. 17. Saboteurs are hiding under the name Niger Delta to delay Biafra. Anybody referring to himself as a Niger Delta, God in heaven knows you are a traitor, their job is to distract us. To make you not to come together to articulate on how to get out of the mess you are into. 18. Biafra is the second most hated people in the whole world apart from Israel. People see you and they hate you for no reason. They see the favour of God on us and they hate us. 19. If you think you are safe, just know we are surrounded. 20. The more they reduce the numbers of our listeners on Facebook, the more I preach. You think this is 1967?. When our people were intimidated by the media, as Biafrans were being massacred, you were busy lying to the world using the media - BBC. 21. Nnia Nwodo and the rest of them never rose up to challenge the issue of artificial boundary by Gowon. 22. Chukwu Okike Abiama said Biafra can never come until you go and unite all my people together. 23. It was remaining only six more months to the Biafra war and we stopped during the war, President Nixton was about to step in but Chukwu Okike Abiama made it so. 24. Once you divide the land of Biafra, Elohim will depart from us his glory will never be with you. This is what our so called elders should have considered. 25. In Otaka village in Obubua Local Government Area in Cross River State they have four market days, they circumcise their children on the eight day. They celebrate new yam festival. 26. Not that we want to force anybody to join Biafra, but we must complete the assignment Heaven gave to us. He will have to shine his light in them so they decide where to belong. 27. Asari Dokubo said he is an Igbo man. No wonder, you said you didn't know who Uchenna Asiegbu is?. Only an Igbo man will deny receiving money after he received it. (truncated)",,,,,,,,,1,-0.88

They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states. 10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 11. You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea. 12. Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes. The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 13. Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 14. Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 15. The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group, you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 16. Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 17. But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB, never. 18. Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea.

William Shakespeare. 

I don't know why people are afraid of letting Nigeria (ZOO) to go, when they knew is not there's?

All the time men  discusses like conductors in the motor parks, as they claimed to be lawmakers in  Nigeria, does that tells you sometimes or reminds you there's no hope in that country?  In the last few days, weeks and months, even in their newspapers  what we hear every day is that security men arrested and  rescued COWS from BANDITS, but not human beings and why are they not asking questions about the killings going on everywhere in the country?

We have terrorists in ASOROCK,  in the governments, states, communities and in our forests, does it make you to lose sleep sometimes? If yes, why is PANTAMI still serving as a minister in Nigeria?

There's one thing these men have in common here, terrorism in Nigeria is a multi billion dollar business and they will do everything to keep it flowing.

We have received the information of our leader's abduction by Nigeria government and their allegations leveled against our leader. 

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay.

Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially.

All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. 

We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged.

We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government.  Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. 

There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. 

We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. 

If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. 

Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria.

Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader.

 We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo.

 Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful.

Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for.

Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it.

Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.

Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem. Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.” He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then. He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote. But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari! Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines. This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large- heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t have known of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari. Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",,,,,,,,,1,-0.88

This  was an article I wrote on the 20th of August 2019, I posted it on  KEMI's blog as one of her top fans, to register my displeasure to her , because her attacks on the Leader of IPOB ; Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and the people of Biafrans, and as expected she blocked me after reading the post , and avoided me as a plague.  I was one of her to fans , please read and remember her in your prayers , she is possessed. 

                                                   ""KEMI:THE CRAFTY SERPENT OF THE ZOO""

The old serpent of the book of Genesis is renowned for its craftiness at deceiving the gullible by twisting lies to appear as truth, and twisting the truth to appear as lies. Twisted lies and twisted truth, these are her potent weapons.

Kemi a Yoruba journalist and a Doctor,  someone one who many believe is engaged in investigative journalism, posted so many articles and video  on her blog through  her foot soldiers , as some one who needs help financially for reason of her health challenges, she was able to attract attention and enough traffic on her blog. 

Today she is healed of all her trauma, thanks to  heaven. I understand that some people did not contribute enough fund as expected especially Biafrans. Her friends organised  a birthday bash to mark her birthday, I guess too, Biafrans did not contribute much towards that. 

Today Kemi, has concluded her investigative journalism on the alleged rape  case involving the  COSA pastor. 

It is time for KEMI to attack IPOB through her blog that has attracted so many traffic especially Biafrans , firstly,  by emphasising on her health challenges to attract sympathy and fund and feed her numerous fans with junk news about her perceived enemies. 

Kemi is now attacking IPOB by echoing the gaffe of the contraption that a renowned most peaceful mass freedom fighting  outfit ever to emerge out of Africa; IPOB is a terrorist group. 

Kemi in her post  accused Mazi Nnamdi Kanu  of being the cause of Sowore's problem. 

My questions to Kemi. Have you ever done any investigative journalism on the current issues bedevilling the country, The Boko Haram, the Fulani herdsmen, the bandits on our high ways? 

Did you ever utter any word, inform of a press statement on the killing of the daughter of the leader of Afenifere?

Have you done your investigative journalism to know why IPOB is agitating for restoration of Biafra ?

Have you caught any IPOB member , with arms before you begin to shout terrorist, terrorist , terrorist?

Did Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in way summoned Sowore to visit him in the States for a discussion on issues concerning your Nigeria?

As someone who is educated, when did a call for self determination mean terrorism in English language or even in your Nigeria constitution ?

If IPOB is a terrorist group,  have they killed any one in your village, how many  women did  they rape in your community?

Why are you angered by the fact that most of your Biafrans  friends did not contribute enough   to your franchise when you already know they are terrorists? 

Are you not a terrorist by expecting donations from terrorists?

Sowore was your favourite candidate in the last presidential  election, why did you suddenly abandon him, now that he needed  young people  like you  to protest against the security situation, and other socio economic problems in your beloved Nigeria?

Is IPOB and Biafra the reason Nigeria is in turmoil, are they the reason for poverty in Nigerian,
 are they the  reason many Nigerian youths are dying in Mediterranean Sea on attempt  to migrate to Europe for greener pastures ?
Are they the reason workers are not well paid or even owed some arrears. 

When Biafrans were disenfranchised during last presidential election, you were mute ,they were beaten and chased out of  the polling units in Lagos state by your brothers and uncles,  you were silent waiting for us to retaliate so you all can justify your gaffe  with your imbecilic and ridiculous  shout,  "" terrorist, terrorist ,terrorist"". 

But deep down your heart you know, we are fighting a just cause. That is why IPOB is a voice to reckon with globally especially  in civilised society?

I love Sowore for standing up as a  man to agitate for the well-being of the Nigerian workers, although I don't believe any more in Nigeria project. 

If someone like Dr. Kemi can  allow ethnic, sentiments, hate and envy to becloud her sense of reasoning, it simply means Nigeria is irreparable. 

DR. KEMI , your attack on IPOB if care is not taken will affect your international status since your action recently speaks volume of some one living in a medieval age, where opportunists attack the oppressed to get favour and financial gratification from the oppressors.   

The attack on Ike Ekweremadu is now the topic that journalist want to use to score cheap point ,now that government of Germany is on  this case Kemi and her  bandwagon of  cash and carry journalist can now (truncated)",,,,0,-82

Cleverly wrote an open letter to FACEBOOK on the frivolous and careless banning of members of IPOB users on their platform thus:......✍️✍️✍️👇👇👇👇👇

Dear Facebook, 

After reading this I would expect you to ban me for another 30 days or 30 years if you prefer. We know you people have been paid handsomely by certain self defeating agents of neo-colonialism in the #Zoo Janjaweed government, which in the main are the same poorly educated and terror minded Fulani reprobates who are the controllers and  beneficiaries of the human abomination and misery we know as the  #Zoo Nigger-area or Nigeria to you. Mind you Flora Shaw the co-founder of Nigger-area always intended to let the world  know the name she chose for her creation has a deep meaning and should serve as a constant reminder that in her opinion Niggers not humans are the inhabitants of the land they colonised in West Africa. 

So in the warped minds of your Lagos based operatives, you lot think by promoting hate speech against Biafra, IPOB, #MNK whilst clamping down on legitimate response to such drivel from aggrieved Biafrans will make you succeed in keeping the diseased #Zoo as one? How sad and pathetic you guys truly are. Your mission is doomed!

You Facebook have never censored, banned or taken down countless hate filled posts by #Zoo animals and their agents directed against Biafra, IPOB or #MNK despite our best efforts to bring such to your attention. Banning IPOB or restricting audience awareness of the posts of IPOB social media activists is now your favourite preoccupation but at the same time you have continued to allow, promote and encourage the distribution of materials injurious to the above mentioned entities. 

You guys at Facebook it seems and despite the fact your company is owned by a Jew who should know better, has become like any other tool of neo-colonialism, designed to control the minds of unthinking Africans by promoting only those materials that serve the interest of those that wish to hold Africa down in perpetual bondage and economic servitude. Only a colosally corrupt institution will be so uneven handed, biased and partial as to promote hate against a party while denying same aggrieved party the right to respond in kind. If you are sincere about upholding your fabled Community Stadards as you regularly remind us, you people should commence immediate banning of #Zoo sponsored e-rats and professional petition writers for their hate speech towards IPOB and her leadership. 

Its unfortunate but not entirely unexpected that those carrying out this organised witch hunt in your Lagos offices are black Africans, some of them, like we in IPOB, in desperate need of rescue from the roundly Satanic and disasterous British colonial creation, the #Zoo Nigger-area. They are inadvertently prologing their miserable existence in the #Zoo by virtue of your campaign against IPOB. How daft can they be? 

Perhaps the DNA of a black man still reads, ""serve any interest that will always undermine your path to freedom and the collective good of the people"". Maybe being evil is in a black man's DNA.

Now you are at liberty to ban me for another 30 days. 

Yours respectfully 

A. Dillion",,,,0,-44

For those of you who have been dancing to the rhythms of the drums of war being continuously beaten by the PDP, Nnamdi Kanu and his IPOB rats, CAN, NCEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Femi Fani-Kayode, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Gani Adam's, Afenifere, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF, etc. I hope the corona virus pandemic and the accompanying lockdown has given you a very faint idea of what a war situation would be like. Just under seven weeks of a lockdown, and you are already screaming of hunger and begging for palliatives from Buhari. Let me assure you that whatever hardships or inconvenience you think you are suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer if war ever breaks out as a result of the ""Biafra or death"", ""Islamization"", ""Fulani jihad"", ""Fulanization"", and ""Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria"" propaganda churned out by Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Yinka Odumakin, Deji Adeyanju, Reno Omokri, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, Middle-Belt Forum, South-South Peoples Forum, PANDEF etc, and your spiritual Papas and Daddy G.Os. They have been beating the drums of propaganda and war with a very big stick, and you have been dancing furious steps to the rhythms. They tell you that Buhari wants to Islamize Nigeria, and you cheer. They say Buhari is the one arming and sending Fulani herdsmen to kill you, and you scream delightedly. They say Buhari wants to kill every Christian in Nigeria, and you believe them. They say Buhari wants to kill every Southerner along with those in the Middle-Belt, and give the vacant land to his Fulani kinsmen, and you agree. They incite the Igbos against other Nigerians, and you rejoice. They incite Christians against Muslims, and you dance for joy. They abuse Northerners and Muslims and Fulanis and the Yorubas, and you celebrate. You call Fulanis and Northerners cows. You call Nigeria a zoo and other Nigerians animals in the zoo. They tell you to get ready to fight a war and defend yourselves and your land against the Sokoto Caliphate and the sons of Usman Dan Fodio, and you scream in excitement. They call the Fulanis bloodthirsty demons from Futa Jallon, and you are giddy with delight. This is the rubbish that the PDP, CAN, NCEF, your Pastors and Daddy G.Os, Nnamdi Kanu, FFK, Reno Omokri, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle-Belt forum, South-South Leaders Forum, PANDEF, etc, have been feeding you with for ages, and you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker, instead of using your braino like rational beings. They have politicised religion and weaponised it as a tool of political blackmail. They have been playing the religious card in a very dangerous and reckless manner since 2014, viciously fanning the smouldering embers of ethno-tribal and religious divisions and hatred. I want to announce to you that if and when the conflagration ignites, whatever you think you're suffering now is not up to one percent of what you will suffer in a war situation. You are screaming for palliatives now, but nobody will give you palliatives in a war situation. I heard that in some parts of the Country, the prices of foodstuffs have risen astronomically. For example, a paint bucket of garri is now selling at N1800 in some parts of the country. The cost of satchets and bags of ""Pure Water"" have doubled. In a war situation, you will buy a paint bucket of garri for N10,000 or more, i.e if you could even see it to buy. Let me not talk about the other staples like yam, beans, rice, cassava, etc. A wrap of ""Akpu"" may cost as much as N1000. You will buy a loaf of bread for N7000, assuming it is even available. You have been shouting ""hunger"" and "" hardship"" since Buhari came to power, but in a war situation, you will know what ""hunger"" and ""hardship"" is. Then you will realize that what you are currently experiencing is Paradise in comparison. You are complaining that you are tired of staying at home because of the lockdown. In a war situation, you will most likely not even have a home to stay in; you will be too busy running for your life or hiding in the bush or the forest, or living in a refugee camp. You are complaining that health facilities are poor; in a war situation, there will be no hospitals to go to, because many of them will be bombed or razed to the ground, and the few available ones will be overflowing with war casualties. Believe you me, those your Daddy G.Os and Spiritual Papas will hop on their private jets and fly out of the Country if and when those embers of ethno-tribal and religious hate they have been fanning ignite, and leave you to face the music. Those Ohanaeze and Afenifere and Middle-Belt Forum and South-South Leaders Forum and PANDEF politicians will race to the nearest Foreign Embassy building and hide themselves there, and leave you to roast in the fire. Unknown to you, many of them hold double and even triple citizenships.

Compiled by Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA Edited by Nwada Emmanuel Chisom(Ada Biafra) 1. Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu 2. Tonight if your coming to listen to us, bring your pen and paper. If you are JANJAWEED, bring your chalk and slate. 3. Whenever i try to teach, I teach subjects that are incontrovertible. 4. We have the ability to reason on a continuous level . 5. Biafra is not like any other nation of the world and we make no apologies to that . 6. The greatest injustice anybody can do to you is to hide the truth from you. 7. What is happening today we foretold it, and we knew they will happen. 8. They so called men of God are afraid because they are not sure of what they are preaching. Instead all they are concerned about is tithes and Offerings. 9. I am saying this too because I am a Christian, controversial, but I will tell you why in short while, why all of us are Christians. 10. What am about to tell you this evening, no pastor knows the meaning of Christianity. Those that knows from Rome, hides it away from you. This night I will tell you. 11. People in Nigga area in Katsina went to do the same protest that you are doing around the world in the name of ""black lives matters"", the organizer of the same protest in Katsina Nastiwa Sharif, was arrested. 12. Amnesty international has reported that they have arrested this man because he is crying out about the killings of his people by bandits. 13. Not all advice from old people you should listen. Some old people grows old. 14. Nobody is more Christian than me. Listen attentively. The best place to start is ,who is a Christian?. According google, Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic teachings of Jesus christ. Meaning the religion teaching of one God. 15. What is the meaning of monotheism, ONE GOD. The same God that Judaism believes in. 16. During the time of Yeshua. The meaning of Yeshua is Chizoba, God saves. 17. The problem with the churches in Nigeria is that you steal money, and you kept quiet. You don't condemn the killings in Nigeria . 18. If not for Urigadari we wouldn't have had mobile phones today. The white people were superstitious like Africans we wouldn't have the mobile phones . 19. The name we bear is enough for me to know that God is real. I don't need a white man to teach me that. 20. My aim is to educate all these criminals, and fake people. 21. Do you actually know the meanig of Israel? It simply means the PRINCE OF GOD. 22. my aim is to educate and not to castigate anybody. Jesus prayed to ""my father in heaven"" so why don't you do what jesus have done? 23. What Europe has done over the years is wherever they go and see the children of light they will deny them their history. 24. Had the Israelites allowed themselves to be bamboozled, will there be israel today? 25. There is a place in Arochukwu called Ihechiowa, the place of light . 26. I told you that Biafra is the kingdom of God on earth. Everywhere they are answering light . How else do you need me to tell you that you are special. 27. And when I see all these blessed children of Biafra going to all these churches pastored by the former Moslems. 28. And then somebody is answering the name ""darkness"", nigga area and you want me to accept them? 29. Do you know why they hate us? because God said that darkness and light does not believe together. And you expect to be accepted by Nigeria which is a darkness? 30. Can you see why I have a problem with someone who answers Niger Delta. And someone wake up and call you darkness. 31. Lugard knows exactly what he was doing when he named you, ""the Great Biafra"" 32. Look at Sourh Africa, who made it beautiful? A white man. Immediately the whites handed over to black people they are backwards like other African countries. 33. You dont have sewage systems, we build a house we kept digging pits for toilets. 34. I want people to understand that we have proof for the migration of people from Israel. 35. The book of Zephaniah 3:10 says, after Ethipiopia you will see my people there. Look at the map, after Ethiopia is Biafara. 36. This is the book you carry everyday, the word of God and you go to those who does not know God to teach you the word of God. 37. The book of Zephaniah 3:10 , says from beyond Ethiopia, and after Ethiopia is the kingdom of Biafara the name of my village, Afara. 38. IPOB is light , the ZOO Nigga area is darkness. 39. Why I am upset with Yoruba is that they are Learned, they went to school, and yet they cannot reason. 40. Fulanis are busy impregnating 6 year olds in the North, these are the bastards you want to be with. 41. They are raping 6 year old children in Nigga area, and you said that you are a Nigerian? These are the people your daddy G.O wants you to be with. 42. Your real name is Nigerian, that's your real name.

#BiafraTV 

We have received the information of our leader's abduction by Nigeria government and their allegations leveled against our leader. 

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay.

Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially.

All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. 

We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged.

We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government.  Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. 

There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. 

We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. 

If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. 

Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria.

Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader.

 We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo.

 Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful.

Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for.

Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it.

Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",,,,0,-24

1.  Opening prayers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. 

2. When Aisha was telling you about her husband none of you listened.

3.  Then she decided to start eating her own money. You are not ashamed her own son Yusuf is the 4th richest man in Africa. 

4. And you are here talking about one Nigeria and igbo Presidency. 

5.  Let me tell you the problem with an igbo man,
 ignorance, stupidity,   jealousy, envy and  greed.

6.  It is only in Africa that someone will come up and say that he hate Messi or Ronaldo for no just course. 

7.  Why did they not allow us to have Biafra? because of Jealousy, because they have Oil and gas and they can go on being rich. 

8.  I never wanted to preach this tonight,  but I sat here behind this microphone tonight,Eluigwe. 

9.  They are in the police, they are in the army and they are in civil defence, is common sense, only these people are in the 36 states.

10. What Miyetti Allah is telling you is that they are everywhere, is common sense. 

11.  You see the army, they are working for Miyetti Allah, sometime they have no idea.

12.  Is like ISIS saying that they are forming vigilantes.  The Fulanis understands the STUPIDITY of a ZOO man. 

13.  Had Buhari remained alive all they would have done is to hand over to another Muslim like TINUBU. 

14.  Do you see how they roll, because they know that you are stupid. 

15.  The British told them, tag IPOB a Terrorist group,  you stop people from subscribing with them and you shot them down from asking for fund abroad. 

16.  Now do you understand, envy and jealousy is the reason those that wants to see IPOB banned were celebrating when IPOB was proscribed. 

17.  But you can not be like Nnamdi Kanu, you cannot be like IPOB,  never.

18.  Somebody wrote in 2018."" There is a proxy war going on in Niggarea. Fulani herdsman are being used to kill and oppresse other tribes .

19.  There is something the world do not know and I will tell you tonight. 

20.  Fulani has a war chest of over billions of dollars which they use to pay off consultants all over the world. 

21.  Trump said ""my friends are making money in Africa "". 
you see, this is how they roll. 

22.  That is why when you go anywhere in the world, they will tell you to go away,  that they want the ZOO to remain one because they don't want to lose their billion dollars contracts. 

23.  Kalamad was the only woman they ZOO couldn't buy off,  and this is why her report that IPOB are being killed by Nigeria has not been released. 

24.  Have you ever wondered,  your stupidity overrides your comon sense, something you suppose to see you cannot. 

25.  Thanks to Radio Biafra,  people are now listening and have started to reason. 

26.  Every position is Fulani, does it mean that 200 million people cannot reason to understand that they have an agenda. 

27.  As soon as Biafra comes, you see this Universities, you will see we will turn it into secondary school, because they are not useful. 

28.  When Fulanis are killing IPOB you don't see the police, but when IPOB is having their meeting then you see the police. 

29.  The ZOO is gone, they are messing with all of you, unless we rise up as one people, otherwise they will keep on messing with all of you.

30. We have come to the end of this broadcast and we shall continue on Wednesday,  and as I said before, Biafra will come and this year of course.

I don't know why people are afraid of letting Nigeria (ZOO) to go, when they knew is not there's?

All the time men  discusses like conductors in the motor parks, as they claimed to be lawmakers in  Nigeria, does that tells you sometimes or reminds you there's no hope in that country?  In the last few days, weeks and months, even in their newspapers  what we hear every day is that security men arrested and  rescued COWS from BANDITS, but not human beings and why are they not asking questions about the killings going on everywhere in the country?

We have terrorists in ASOROCK,  in the governments, states, communities and in our forests, does it make you to lose sleep sometimes? If yes, why is PANTAMI still serving as a minister in Nigeria?

There's one thing these men have in common here, terrorism in Nigeria is a multi billion dollar business and they will do everything to keep it flowing.

Because they are looking for free land or they couldn't use their money to acquire any plot of land.... What a flimsy excuse! You know ignorance of what exactly is the true history of Nigeria is the reason why you will blame any Igbo man. That's what the slave masters want you to do so as to always use divide and rule to dominate you because they know their is power in the unity of Ndị Igbo That no land bother or sea is working in Igbo land to help our importers is also the fault of Ndị Igbo right? That theirs no functional international or local cargo airport is also the fault of Ndị Igbo right? That from Abuja to South East has over 100 police and military checkpoints extorting our commuters and making the price of transport high just to make an Igbo man see his fellow as selfish is also the fault of Ndị Igbo right? That any Igbo man such as Airpeace Boss Onyema, Innoson, Ifeanyi Uba and Co are persecuted by EFCC just to cripple any Igbo man making waves is also the fault of Ndị Igbo right?

Compiled by 
Mazi IKECHUKWU ONUOHA 

Edited by 
Nwada Emmanuel Chisom (Ada Biafra)

1.  An opening prayer by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.

2.  We are doing the best we can to make sure we come to you Live and Direct!!! However, we are going to see what we can do to rectify the problem,  but if all efforts fail, or should there be any interruption during the broadcast of which I am sure there will be, please use other platform such as our Radio Biafra App.
Darkness can not stop us this evening.

3.  Tonight we start by laying a background as we normally do.

4.  Such an important and critical meeting you have been asking for ages , and now you finally got it and what did you do? you run quickly to Abuja, acting to be in control of IPOB, can you imagine such an utter garbage. 

5.  All of you who have been advising me to take it easy with Ohaneze,  you tell me, what have we done to them now? 

6.  Somebody has even said that having a meeting with Ohaneze is like Aburi Accord,  they will say one thing and do another thing. 

7.  I don't want people to say that we are stubborn and we don't listen, now we have given them the opportunity and have you seen where it led us?

8.  They even said in their press release that IPOB should work hand in hand with Tony Nnadi one man band, onye ara bu file akpaghari.

9.  This was the same thing they did when we had the JANJAWEED ebe di njo, and they have done it again.

10.  So this has been their plan all along, so that they can show their masters that they are in control. 

11.  We must continue,  we have to continue. 

12.  There was a Revolution now that happened in Abuja today, and you should have seen the convoy of military men and police and many people were arrested just for doing a protest. 

13.  The army said that they have no men to fight Bokoharam and protect families in Southern Kaduna, but you have more men, and more men to go and arrest protesters. 

14.  You've heard of violence protest going on around the world and none has been arrested. 

15.  The army left the war front, the army left Southern Kaduna to go and arrest those who are fighting for you for a better living. 

16.  Some of you forgot that communism collapsed in Soviet union because soldiers refused to shoot at the protesters. 

17.  Some of you,  you wake up in the morning , you wear that your stupid army uniform,  or civil defense uniform, you go out to arrest people who are fighting for freedom for the looters. 

18.  I don't know what is wrong with the HAUSA, the same mistakes you made in the past, you are repeating today. 

19.  Hausa I am asking you, does it mean you people enjoy being slaves? 

20.  Have you not seen the video of the national guard in America that were called out to stop protesters,  and later joined the protesters?

21.  Some of you fools cannot reason very well, if you are privileged with a bit of a common sense , you won't be going out there to arrest those fighting for your freedom. 

22.  Britain knows that Fulani owes Bokoharam and ISWAP,  have they killed anyone? It appears that the more armed you are , the more you are feared and respected. 

23.  You are carrying a gun arresting someone who are fighting for good road , there is something wrong with a black man's head? 

24.  I keep asking a black man, don't you have shame? That a white man can come and build you a country. 

25.  You shouting one Nigeria,  ask yourself this question, why is it that when FULANI'S are attacking when you call the army they won't respond? 

26.  They planned what they are doing many years ago, including the idiots that are going about arresting people and yet your villages are under siege, your mothers are being raped. 

27.  We are not fighting for marginalisation,  we are fighting for freedom and we are not waiting for anyone. 

28.  Come and join IPOB, let's join hands and make Biafra another Japan. 

29.  Breaking News!!!!!
ISIS and Al-Qaeda are planning to invade the South , and they will take it. What happened to Israel will happen to us, we will have to fight our way back in.

30.  As some of you sabo are busy doing your work for the ZOO, some of you your mothers will be raped. 

31.  And I kept asking them, what are you doing in the ZOO army? 

32.  All if you idiots canvassing for igbo presidency,  let me tell you, the history of your people they kill. you're here you run away to another place, they kept killing you and you are running around like a stomach upset. 

33.  Thunder will fire all of you fighting for new Nigeria gabarge,  you will all will die a painful death.

34. You want to contest for Nigeria Nigeria Presidency,  they hate you , Fulani hates you , you are like a goat following the owner , one day they will slaughter you and use you for celebration. 

35.  All of you idiots has forgotten what they are doing to you , but tonight am here to remind you.

▪️Compiled By Comr Nwawube Ezeobi, Comr Ezeobi Jonel | Biafra Post May 26, 2020

▪️Intro ===} As tradition demands, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu renders thunderous prayers to heaven.

1. We are going to preach without prejudice. I will start this evening by dissecting the stupidity of an Igbo man. Do you want me to beg you, so you can defend your land?. Are you not foolish?.

2. We had a whole year to plan the war, until the war came, we start running around, five Million souls already layed dead. Same thing is happening now.

3. People are not cooperating, that is why only five thousand (5000), European men took over Africa.

4. Nzeogwu, Ironsi, and Azikiwe, they were all born in the feudal North, and fought for one Nigeria.

5. People don't want to associate with Arochukwu because of slavery, this is one of the reasons why God is angry with us.

6. Most of the settlements in Ikwerre are people sold into slaves and they were their till the end of slavery.

7. God anger have been with us for a long time.

8. Due to our individualism, we are where we are today. It is a very sober broadcast this evening.

9. They have tested their first Bomb in Imo State, two persons died. You know they installed their boy Hope Uzodimma there.

10. We are the miscreants but those who are doing the killings, Nnia Nwodo exonerated them.

11. Five million people died because there was no plan, the same thing that happened then is happening now, fifty solid years, Igbos have learnt nothing only claiming intellectuals.

12. A white man have shame, honour and integrity, black man have none that is the difference between a white man and a black man.

13. I begged you to donate one dollar each in Los Angeles, somebody asked why, I said it is because we need to prepare. Did you do it?.
They were thinking if all of us contribute dollar each, Nnamdi Kanu will have millions now. Now Fulanis' are in your place.

14. Most of you in America are not spiritual, if you are you will know why Elohim sent you to America.

15. The love you have for your nation is the greatest love and your willingness to sacrifice to keep your nation progressing, not like the zoo.

16. Fulani Janjaweed went as far as Madagascar to bring drugs.

17. Every blessed day, Fulani Janjaweed is telling you, showing you they hate you.

18. Elohim will give us Biafra, what we will do to you people in America, the world will wonder, I say my thing laud and clear so that your envy will increase.

19. In 1967 we lost five million souls and in the year 2020, you are still doing the same thing. 

20. Let me see anyone that say he is contesting for election, then you will buy rice and beans, today those you want to vote for you have their lives under threat and you can't do no anything

21. Every four years, they come out and ask you to  vote for us and they will later stall whoever they like in Abuja.

22. I wonder what our ancestors will be thinking of you people right now. Serve your people and you are asking what you are going to gain.

23. In 2009 I told those in the north one day they will kill you and you will abandon all your properties.

24. Fulani hates you because Nzeogwu killed Ahamdu Bello. Nzeogwu was trying to save Nigeria.

25. Elohim please give us Biafra so we can set example with those stingy bastard in America.

26. They cannot learn from Kosovo and Armenia.

27. We are fighting for our freedom at the most difficult time, where there is no trust, the little trust left was destroyed by Uwazuruike.

28. Defending our land is a collective effort. You want me to beg you before you can rise up and defend your land. When George Washington was fighting for America, did he have to beg people to join?. That is the America you are enjoying.

29. There will be no movement on 30th May, atleast till its noon.

30. If you truly believe in something, I don't think anything anybody say will make you change your stand.

31. Our goal is simply to get Biafra.

32. You cannot see a Christian or Muslim renouncing their faith. People don't know that Biafra is a religion.

33. You said somebody insulted you and because of that you cannot fight for Biafra again but Almajiri have been in your village killing since 1945. Peter was crucified upside down in Rome, did it stop them?.

#BiafraTV 

We have received the information of our leader's abduction by Nigeria government and their allegations leveled against our leader. 

We condemned the abduction in its totality and we urge Nigeria government to immediately release and return Mazi Nnamdi kanu to his hometown Umuahia without further delay.

Nigeria government should stop provoking its citizens to move to the direction they never planned or wanted to move to initially.

All the allegations leveled against our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu are all lies and I want the world to note it and receive this press release as the authentic information about ESN. 

We are only interested in the security of our region just as the North Nigeria are in charge of the security of their region. Same with South south by Amatekun security men. We have never engaged in anything unlawful or breaking of prisons or killing of our brothers in the south East as Nigeria government accused or alleged.

We are well trained and cultured to do this security work at the level of international capacity. Let Nigeria government not provoke us to carry arms against the government.  Let the President of Nigeria, President Buhari allow us to stay peacefully as we have remained and flush out insecurity in our region. 

There is right for self determination, we already know that Nigeria don't like us, they hate igbos and it is irredeemable hatred and because of that we wish to secede and be on our own despite what we will loose as a result of leaving Nigeria. 

We have shown willingness to leave Nigeria despite what we tend to loose and promised Nigeria that Biafra land will gain all we lost in Nigeria within a space of three years just as we were able to stand tall despite the damages done to our land during the war 1967- 1970. 

If Buhari continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu unjustly, let the international community hear this, let Britain hear this, let US, hear this, let UN hear this, let the world hear this, let this message be made to get to those concerned, we will not let any sand rest in Nigeria. 

Like I said, we are ordinary security men interested in the security work of our region. Let no one redirect our minds to what this country will regret. Buhari will not continue to hold our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu and expect peace in Nigeria.

Malami should be cautioned, lai Mohammed should be cautioned, DSS should be cautioned on the way and manner they handle our leader.

 We have no business with the zoo and we don't tend to do any business with the zoo.

 Buhari administration was not able to stop bokoharam and they want to turn another volunteer security group into a terrorist group by holding their innocent leader and labelling him with all sorts of things when actually they know he is innocent. Let this administration ask questions about volunteers group how anyone can stop them when they tend to do anything either lawful or unlawful.

Freedom fighters exist all over the world, secession is not a crime but a right of determination through referendum which our leader Mazi Nnamdi kanu is asking for.

Let international community know that as at today 2nd of July 2021. ESN are still ordinary security network only interested in the security work of our region. We are only interested to stop the insecurity Buhari administration brought to South East Nigeria. We are only interested to stop herdsmen from killing and raping our mothers, innocent children, our aged fathers, our youths, destroying our farms. No region will keep mute and watch another person from another region destroy his land, if others tolerate that, South East will never tolerate it.

Let international community also know that Buhari administration want to turn us into uncivilized security network because we will not take it lightly with Nigeria if they continue to hold our leader.",,,,0,-18

By Farooq Kperogi

I’ve known since the beginning of the month that Nnamdi Kanu would be arrested and extradited to Nigeria, but my informant swore me to secrecy, so I kept the information to myself. Today he has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria. 

While the mass resentment against Buhari in the Southeast is a justified response to his systematic exclusion of and open rhetorical and actual hostility to the region, Nnamdi Kanu is NOT a symptom of the Southeast’s legitimate angst. He is a different but related problem.

Kanu is a violent, vulgar, venomous-tongued thug that should never have been allowed to exploit the valid angst of the Southeast to rise to prominence. The intolerant, unthinking IPOB cult he has built has become a problem not just for Nigeria but for the vast majority of Igbo people everywhere. 

When Kanu was burst forth to the forefront of national and international visibility in July 2015 through the Buhari regime’s thoughtless handling of Radio Biafra, I took the time to listen to him on Radio Biafra. I found a man gibbering vulgar, violent, incoherent, hate-filled but comical rants. He called Nigeria a “zoo”— or the “zoological republic”— and Nigerian citizens “monkeys” or “ill-educated vagabonds.”

 He labeled Igbos who didn’t share in his idiocy as “Hausa-born children in Igboland.” His rants were also filled with racially self-hating, negrophobic rhetoric, such as his claims that black people were inherently intellectually inferior and incapable of deep thought. He said he was a “Jew.” He hasn’t changed since then.

He makes no effort to be persuasive. He simply revels in tasteless abuse, intentional prevarications, infantile temper tantrums, and a melodramatic display of rank, comical illiteracy. In my July 2015 column, I said the only people who would take him seriously and be affected by his message were people who already shared his twisted, hateful ideals, which made shutting down his station pointless. “I can bet that it does not speak for nor reach the majority of Igbo people, and that most Igbo people would snigger when they listen to it,” I wrote.

But the Buhari regime made Kanu more popular than he is worth. He was spewing his rib-tickling inanities on the fringes of the Internet and on a barely known radio station. Then, suddenly, when he started attacking President Buhari, Nigerian authorities moved in swiftly to contain him. They announced that they had successfully jammed his radio station but came back a few days later to refute an alleged libelous falsehood the station made against Buhari!

Of course, news of the “jamming” of the radio and the press release refuting what the station reportedly said against Buhari (after it was supposed to have been jammed!) caused the station—and the ideology it espouses—to make national and international headlines. And there was an enormous spike in the number of searches for “Radio Biafra” and “Nnamdi Kanu” on Google and other search engines.

This, combined with Buhari’s unambiguous antipathy toward the southeast, has sparked a resurgence of Biafran and neo-Biafran movements and periodic sanguinary communal upheavals. This was completely avoidable. If the government had ignored (or quietly diluted) Kanu and his Radio Biafra and demonstrated even token large-heartedness toward the southeast (and the deep south) in the immediate aftermath of Buhari’s epochal electoral triumph in spite of opposition from the region, we wouldn’t have known of Kanu and IPOB. But Nigerian authorities couldn’t stomach an insult at Buhari.

Whatever it is, I have no tears for Kanu. No reasonable person should. But I think the man needs more sorrow than anger because he is obviously mentally unhinged.",,,,0,-18

The only way an Igbo Presidency can be Possible in this Country right now is by the rendering of a Public Apology from Ndigbo and a strong Soldarity March Nation wide for ONE NIGERIA.

We can't support or Pretend to love Nigeria only during election periods. 

We can't Pretend to love other tribes only on election seasons, NO!

We can't be Patriots only when we need Nothern votes.

For now we have dumped the ""Biafra Agitation"" because election is coming up in few Months. 

We will probably go back to our Biafra Agitation if our Preferred candidate doesn't win in the Zoo right? WHAT A JOKE.

A country we so hate, berate, castigate, Blackmail and attack without any Provocation, is that the same country we are aspire to Preside over?

So we actually believe this Country will Pretend as if nothing happened and vote an Igbo man as President? This is a bad dream and we must wake up from it.

Have we taken our time to ask ourselves why our BELOVETH PDP abandoned us and zoned their Ticket to the North?

We all should keep shouting for division, we should all keep attack!ng our fellow citizens, we should all keep abus!ng other tribes and religions that has done nothing wrong to us.

Before I conclude, I just want to remind us all that A MAN CAN'T GET MARRIED TO THE WOMAN HE HATES SO MUCH. You must cherish and love the woman you wish to spend the rest of your life with. 

We must therefore support, defend, pray and stand with Nigeria both in good and bad situations before we can be considered to sit and Preside at this Country’s Center of affairs.
